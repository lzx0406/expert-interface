But the reason I started here is I wanted to show you this. It's a miniature maple tree. The leaves haven't come out yet. But this is what I wanted to show you. It's an egg case for a praying mantis. So if I'm lucky and I time it right, I'll be around when they start hatching out of there and hopefully get some pictures and video of them whenever that day comes. Right now, mostly daffodils are out. A couple tulips. And I'll just give you a quick overview. Kind of a lot of empty space. Rebuilding some things here. A lot of green of flowers to come later in the month or in May. There's another one. I love that flower, but maybe this year I'll pick a new channel icon. And these grape hyacinths are just starting out. There's a lot of them all along the border. This way and all the way around the front. This azalea is going to be a blazing pink. It's going to be great. And here's a few miniature daffodils. Around this tree, this birch tree. Nice daffodils again. Plenty of these around. This is a little tiny, comes from a tiny bulb. Comes back every year. I think I had this tiny, one or two flowers originally a couple years ago. In that spot and it's spreading. Is that one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Another one back here. And another one here that's not open yet. I can't, there it goes. It started out over here and now it's spreading across. So hopefully over the next couple of years this whole area will be filled with it. And then that's it. It's just a one time show. Blue flowers for the first few weeks of spring and gone until next year. Hello. I'm just looking. I'm just looking. I'm just looking. How do you say it? The market. The market. The market.

You can nearly touch them.\nTranscript: So we're going to be taking Georgie and Yami a walk. Let's go. Yeah. Time for a drive. And it's an enrichment walk. We do this with all the lions. It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back. There we go. There we go. Don't say I don't love you. So I hope you enjoyed your walk with Georgie and Yami.

I'm the director of Genesis Wildlife Conservation Center and the Sanctuary. We began in about 1983, and then it grew from there so that we're now a charity. We collect from the people who come here, donors. Some of it we get from foundations. But we rehab about 600 to 700 birds and animals every year. Most of them are released back to the wild, and some of them can be released to their own environment. Music Because he's so small, he wouldn't really stand a chance out in the wild. Are you guys looking for someone to take him in? No, we keep him and use him for education. You have to have permits to have any of the animals. We have to have federal, state, USDA permits, everything. Music I know. That's why we keep them well padded. All the cages are padded, so when they fall, they only fall to the bedding. That's Samsara. Sam I've had since 1998. Music Such beautiful birds. Sasha is now six months old. She came to us as a baby about five weeks old when the whole nest fell to the ground. Her brother did just fine, and he's already been released. But the female, Sasha, on the x-ray, it shows the right wing just really shattered and not able to pin it. So that's why she stays with us. And we take her around to schools, and we talk about their habitat and the need to preserve it. Music This black and white one down here, though, that has an interesting story because see how her wing droops? That's only part of her injuries. I had released her along with a bunch of other pigeons. And then when she came back, she was in the backyard, like in the middle of February, and it was snow everywhere. And I looked out the back window, and it was just blood everywhere. And I ran out to see what it was, and it was this poor little pigeon. And she had come back to get cared, I guess, or at least it was a safe haven for her. So we treated her. She's blind in one eye. She had a lot of, I mean, her whole side was ripped off. The wing was broken. So I treated her back. She fell in love with the old fantail pigeon. And when the old fantail got sick, she would take care of him. I had him inside in a small cage. She would get up under his wing and walk him to the dinner dish. And her story is that when she was about three weeks old, some kids found her in the bushes, probably while her mom was moving them from one place to another. So she spent the next nine weeks at the animal control, where she was placed in a cage next to dogs and cats. And then she was taken to the vet. So she didn't learn to fear any of us. So that's why she's got to stay with us. I tried to release her a couple times, and it was a failure each time. This one over here is Cali, Calahari. And Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. So she's about seven years old, and she's had a pretty bad life before. I got her from animal control in Ashe, and she had been there 11 months, and they were not able to place her with anybody that had a USDA permit. And you have to have a USDA permit to keep these cats. Hey, come on in. She was just spayed. Again, we use these in educational programs to show people that they really are very sweet animals. They're extremely intelligent, very curious animals. ♪♪ People think the only thing they're good for is just for shooting. They're just supposed to be a sport animal, and they're not. Of course, they serve a lot of different purposes, but other than that, they have their own right to live just because they are. God made all of us, and we all have a right to live. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ You can go to our website, which is genesiswildlife.org, and you can get an idea about our volunteer relationships. We have a lot of volunteers here. We have a lot of groups that come. Sometimes we can get 15 or 20 people. And, of course, you put in three hours. That's an incredible amount of work that we can get done in just one day. So it's really nice when we get Cub Scouts or ASU volunteers. As a matter of fact, we had the ETSU come, and they were the ones that built this whole deck behind me. They built the entire thing in one day, but we had about 20 big guys come here to do that. As far as donations, it's just not monetarily, but you can also donate lumber. You can donate time. You can donate equipment. We get a lot of people who just come with their building their homes, and they have a lot of leftover lumber, a lot of things like that. They can come, and we can use all of that lumber. We can use everything. We get people who just bring in linens, which is extremely important to us. Some people will bring in some of the dog food and the sunflower seeds, bags of bird seed. All of these things can be donated to us.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: The Feral Pig in Australia Feral pigs in Australia\nTranscript: The Feral Pig, probably Australia's favourite game. First released by Captain Cook for a food source for the pioneers of this country, the Feral Pig has thrived in our conditions and multiplied to almost plague proportions. Up here in the territory, the good living has seen the Feral Pig population explode. Cape York is probably the first destination most people think of when they think of pig hunting, but up here in the territory, their numbers are just as strong. I've heard of boars up to around 240 kilos being caught in the territory, but between 80 and 100 kilos is a good sized boar. They are an environmental terrorist, destroying vast tracts of land. In the south, they destroy crops and livestock, decimating the income of our already struggling farmers. Up here in the north, they tear our wetlands and national parks to shreds. No wetland has been left untouched. They act as carriers of weeds and exotic diseases, and they tear up the land until it becomes a mess of impassable pig ruts. Anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of driving across them will know what I mean. With a keen sense of smell, excellent hearing, and razor sharp tusks, pigs can be considered as dangerous game. Wounded animals are especially dangerous, and I've had a few close calls with wounded boars. There seems to be a lot of difference in opinion on what is the best calibre of hunting pigs. My opinion is, if it kills them, use it. I've shot them with everything from a .22 to a .375 Ultramag, but the latter can get quite expensive when you look at how many pigs we have up here. The smaller calibres can have problems penetrating the thick fighting pads and mud on the larger boars, so aiming at the base of the ear is your best bet when shooting with a small calibre. When using the bigger calibres, aiming tight behind the shoulder has always yielded good results for me. Herds of 30 or more are not uncommon. A group of animals this large will destroy a patch of dirt bigger than a football field every single food sitting. The feral pig is a real menace, and we as hunters need to do our part.\nComment: I'm ready to do my part. Send me an invite to go up north and I'll be glad to help out any farmer that needs pig numbers lowered on there land.

After five weeks, there's only room inside the hole for him. Once a pair have found their ideal home, they'll keep on coming back for years.

And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around.\nComment: Did you actually watch and listen to the video? They were deer hunting for christs sake! What caliber would you carry for deer?

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Video Evidence of Taxpayer Dollars Wasted on Everglades Bridging & Water Pollution Killing Wildlife The news stations and public have been misinformed about the water flowing south through the new 81 to 100 million dollar one mile bridge. The fact is that not a drop has been let through as of yet; the water is too polluted according to National Park regulations to run it south through the National Park. The question is if the water is flowed south will it be able to flow through the National Park the majority of the year? Now a 2.6 mile bridge is in sight, and additional 2.9 miles of bridging to proceed it. The problem we see is that the first 1 mile bridge has not yet been tested. The truth to the whole matter is, the Everglades biggest problem lies up north with pollution that should be corrected before spending taxpayers money on a science project that will be a permeant costly disaster if it does not work.We have studied the water flow patterns through the existing culverts for many decades. We have seen how the wildlife has been affected and have analyzed the situation as a whole. The ecosystem and wildlife is disappearing and suffering. Wildlife is becoming smaller in size, becoming weaker, and natural life spans are getting shorter. In 1998 a florida panther was found dead in Everglades Shark River Slough with levels of mercury so high it could kill an adult human.Right now and for the past several months before the 81 to 100 million dollar bridge was even finished water has actually been flowing through the National Park from south to north through the existing culverts; yes, backwards because the water is too polluted. Everyday a test by one of us has been conducted on the bridge to test the direction of the water flow. A hand full of sand is dropped at the opening, but it sinks straight to the bottom. If the flow of water was flowing south the sand would visibly be carried in that direction. Imagine 2.6 miles of water flowing backwards, (yes north) verses the culverts that are in place now. That equals a lot more water traveling north because water pollution regulations do not permit them to flow south through the National Park. Also sending water south would require permission from the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, which owns lands south of Lake Okeechobee and north of Everglades National Park. The Miccosukee Tribe is against the polluted waters being flowed into their land, and they are taking action to preserve their way of life. They would not be able to survive if the water and food is all poisoned. According to Earth Justice the pumps for polluted water on average contribute the equivalent of 60,000 one hundred pound bag of phosphorus to Lake Okeechobee each year.If the bridging is in place unnatural water depths will follow unnatural hydro-periods and water flow patterns. Now all the wildlife's hammocks will be under water, and there will be no dry land. This will result in unhealthy conditions. More water, more water, more water, is not the answer; Clean water, clean water, clean water, is the answer! Because of being in a hurry to build all these bridges that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars are we really going to sacrifice one environment to stop salt water intrusion down south into the bay? Remember there's only one Everglades and its all connected. All these bridges do not save the Everglades, they flood and pollute them more then they already are. We are affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. We have to treat the source of infection instead of covering it up with a bandaid.\nTranscript: Here we are west of the 2.6 mile bridge proposed area at the S333 lock. Water is not flowing into the Tamiami Trail Canal, the lock is closed. Here we are south of that lock. The water is traveling from the west to the east in the canal south of Tamiami Trail. These overflow pipes were located in this area and removed. When water levels would reach the height of the top of the pipe would flow into the pipe. They would act as an overflow and then flow water south into the canal, flowing the water into the National Park. The water now is flowing at a much more rapid rate into the National Park. The problem is it is making a U-turn and finding the path of least resistance due to sawgrass and a southern ridge. It is making a U-turn and flowing north instead of south. The opposite of what it is supposed to do. As the water flows north it travels through these pipes, culverts that flow into the Tamiami Trail Canal. This area is the center of the 2.6 mile proposed bridge. A bridge located here instead of the culverts would flow way more water north, completely drying out the south. You can see the rapid flow rate with three culverts. Imagine a bridge drying out and creating an unnatural drought south of the Tamiami Trail, interrupting the natural process of this part of the Everglades. Wildlife would suffer. Wildlife has already suffered enough due to over 25 years of held water in these areas and too much water and now more water is proposed, over 2 feet more in the canal. As of right now the National Park does not flow water south due to over 10 parts per billion of water pollution regulations. They have not been able to flow water south even through the one mile bridge. Here you can see water rapidly flowing north through these culverts, the area and center of this 2.6 mile bridge. This is not where the bridge should be located. During droughts this area has always flowed water north. Instead of here, the S3334 locks, when opened, create a suction that even increases drastically the water flow north from the south side, drying up the area even faster. Look at the flow going north into the Tamiami Trail Canal. The Everglades does not travel north, should not travel north. Man has interrupted water flows all over the entire Everglades and we are going to do it again with an irreversible situation and billions of taxpayer dollars. This is where the 2.6 mile bridge would be located. The locks at 3333 are closed. The water is traveling south down the L67 Canal making a U-turn and going back north you can see here on the map. The Blue Shanty, the new river, allowing large amounts of water flow north. This is the S3334 lock area. It is also closed. When opened and water flows south, this creates that suction, vacuum, dropping the water sometimes overnight or days, 6 to 8 inches. Unnatural, completely, not allowing the wildlife to adapt. This is not what is supposed to happen with the bridging. The bridging has to be thought about. The 1 mile bridge has not flowed a drop of water south ever since finished. The public has completely been misinformed. Taxpayer dollars are not at work. The 100 million dollar bridge has not worked. We have stopped and checked this area 3 to 4 times a week with a simple test. Water is not flowing in any direction and has not. When the lock is opened at the S333, it will flow south but sawgrass will clog the area restricting lots of flow. And again, taxpayer dollars will not be well spent. And right now, we must at least test the 1 mile bridge before creating more bad decisions. Another 2.6 mile bridge and maybe even more bridging. Bridge is not working right now. It has not for many, many months. The only way to make this water flow south is to create an unnatural level in the canal which will flow and flood the area, being detrimental and terrible for wildlife, especially mammal life. Heavy pollution coming from the north will kill aquatic life, affecting the food chain. This is not the Everglades restoration. This is the Everglades destruction.\nComment: Kev Kilo Thank you for your reply Sir. Are you aware that when there is a drought or when the locks at #334 are opened the water flows from South to North underneath the culverts where the center of the proposed 2.6 Mile Bridge is planned to be built? "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

You can nearly touch them.\nTranscript: So we're going to be taking Georgie and Yami a walk. Let's go. Yeah. Time for a drive. And it's an enrichment walk. We do this with all the lions. It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back. There we go. There we go. Don't say I don't love you. So I hope you enjoyed your walk with Georgie and Yami. If you subscribe and join us, you can come on more of these walks and see these two guys grow up and join them on their adventures as they become big lions. Join us next time on a walk with Georgie and Yami. .\nComment: Just pure love from Kevin to his lions ❤️"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

You both had no right doing what you did. In this instance idc if she charged, it serves you both right!!! This is why bears are disappearing. And most likely you weren't even making noise you probably were quiet the whole time and the woofing was her warning and yet these bullheaded humans didn't heed it and she charged as a result. Then they turned on the camera and said let's upload a video to YouTube to cover our asses.

And I feel that that is because they know what kind of life that baby is going to have and they don't want the baby to go through it. So they would rather just kill it as soon as it's born. It's a chain of cruelty that we have to stop right now. And the people who can stop it are the tourists coming to Thailand. They are the ones with the power. I am Catherine Connor, the founder of Bunlok Elephant Sanctuary Bless in Sukhothai, Thailand. Here, our number one priority is the elephant's welfare. We're not interested in profit. We're not interested in keeping the tourists happy. We just want to make a difference to the lives of these abused elephants. The rhythm here is beautiful. It's slow. We work on elephant time. You know, when the elephants want to go, we follow. If they want to stop and graze, we wait. And I think that for a lot of people who come here, it's a whole different world. It's a whole different way of looking and dealing with life. And I think that we change people when they come here. Here we have Phang Noi and Phang Soi. And behind you, you have Wassana, Lotus and Phang Dao. And they are collectively known as the Gossip Girls because they are non-stop trumpeting, roaring, squeaking, purring. You see, normally the cameras are all on them. People are wondering when it's going to be their turn. I have always had a passion for animals. And when I came to Thailand, I knew I wanted to see elephants. I began to volunteer at an elephant center in North Thailand. And I met a baby elephant called Bunrot, which is Thai for survivor. That baby elephant reached out and touched me. He changed my life forever. If he hadn't have died, I'm not sure I would have created BLAST because I would have just all my attention and all my focus and all my funds would have been going on to him. Elephants in Thailand, they were always held in very high regard. They were used for logging. And in 1989, Thailand banned that. And so what happened was thousands of elephants and their owners were unemployed. So what do they do? They're not going to give up their elephant. They need to provide for their family. That is when elephant tourism was born. Elephants are forced to perform tricks and the training that goes on to achieve that is diabolical. They're put through a breaking process. The baby elephant is stabbed repeatedly and beaten repeatedly until the spirit is broken. What it then becomes is a machine for the tourist trade. This is Bunthong. We found her in a tourist camp in Pattaya, giving trekking rides. So that means she had that big heavy chair on her back. As a result of years of doing that, she has a broken back. This is Wassana. She stood on a landmine when she was illegally logging on one of the Thai borders. Despite the fact that she is missing parts of her front foot, she was still sold into the tourist trade and forced to give rides. I mean at the end of the day, I don't think any of us are cruel. And I think most of the cruelty that goes on with elephants in Thailand is lack of education. I think most of these elephant owners don't know the damage that they're doing to their elephant's spine and joints. If they knew, I would hope that they would stop. At Bless, we have three guest houses that sleep two people each. We charge people to stay here. We have no programme, no schedule. We never encourage our guests to approach the elephant, encroach on their space. Our vision is to rescue the abused elephants, to recuperate them, to teach them how to be elephants again and then to release them onto protected land where they can live as wild elephants again. One of the biggest things for me, the thing that amazes me about them the most, is their ability to forgive. You know, these elephants, all of them have been abused by us, by humans. And yet, here they are, comfortable, accepting us, allowing us into their space, allowing us to walk along beside them. I just find that incredible.\nComment: Katherine Conner is an amazing woman!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back. There we go. There we go. Don't say I don't love you. So I hope you enjoyed your walk with Georgie and Yami.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: I wished all animals we're protected as this amazing big cats."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Yes, that's why he gets daily meds am & pm to help sooth his joints, the warm weather helps too :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: CARACAL Species Spotlight - Big Cat TV Note:  Big Cat Rescuers no longer enter cages, even of the lesser cats, unless the cat is shifted to the other half of their cage.  Even a small wild cat can inflict serious injury.In this episode we look at a lesser cat called the Caracal. Their name is taken from a Turkish word that means \"black ear.\" The Caracal is known best for its large black ears that it uses for its great hunting ability.The Caracal roams the grasslands and open plains from Africa through the Middle East. While its numbers are holding in Africa, we see populations becoming extinct in India due to farming and the unrestricted manufacturing of charcoal from the wild weeds, especially in the Banni grasslands. By supporting animal conservation in these areas we can help save the land for the Caracals and other wildlife. Captive Caracals in the US suffer from people trying to keep them as pets, as well as trying to crossbreed them with domestic cats for the pet trade.For more info about BIG CAT RESCUE visit:  us on FACEBOOK:     YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, so today's species spotlight is on the caracal, which most people say, what is a caracal? Well, we're going to show you one and talk a little bit about them. That is Crackle, and she is a caracal. Caracals are sometimes called desert lynx, but in all reality, they are more closely related to your domestic cat at home than to any of the lynx, being either Siberian lynx or Canadian lynx. One of the characteristics that make them very unique is the fact that they have a pretty plain solid coat. There are only a few other cats that have that sort of coat without markings, and that would be cougars and lions, and strangely enough, they are about the same color as the caracals. The caracals have jet black ears, the back of their ears are black, and they have long tufts, just like the lynx, so that's probably why a lot of people associated them with the lynx or thought they were related. So caracals are found throughout Africa, and they're actually found through the Middle East and parts of Asia, and strangely enough, geographically, caracals are found in the same areas that you find cheetahs. Cheetahs and caracals were found in actually the same locations, and one of the things about these two species is they were both trained by humans to hunt animals on behalf of the humans. So the caracals were trained to hunt birds, rabbits, small gazelles, and of course the cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey. Very fascinating that both of these animals were not tamed, but conditioned by humans to hunt animals, and there was actually contests at one time between the caracals to see which one could kill the most birds, the most pigeons in a flock, and the cheetahs, which one could go fastest and bring down the biggest prey. For the most part, the smaller cats, the smaller predators, they eat animals relative to their size, so they would eat smaller birds or mice, but the caracals actually go after much larger prey. So one of the coolest things about the caracals is that they have this uncanny leaping ability, and they can actually catch birds on the wing. They've been recorded in the wild as jumping up to three meters high, which is almost about as high as I am right now. One of the other facts about caracals is they often live in the plains, and a lot of times they're found where the forest meets the plains. This does put them vulnerable to lions, hyenas, leopards, some of the bigger predators, and oftentimes they do fall prey to these larger animals. So they're not always the hunter, a lot of times they become the hunted. So one of the strange things about the caracal is in a lot of their range, especially in Asia and the Middle East, they're considered endangered, because they're very rare. And then on the other hand, in Africa, a lot of times caracals are considered nuisance, and they're just simply killed because they're a threat to livestock. Here at Big Cat Rescue, all of our caracals were former pets. Along with the serval, the caracal is just very popular among cat collectors, and probably one of the biggest misconceptions with the caracals is the fact that they are so cute when they are babies. They are the most adorable little kittens you've ever seen. Most people don't realize they're going to grow up to be this hissy animal that's going to spray on everything and try to bite you all the time. And there's been several attempts to hybridize these animals, some successful, some not successful, with domestic cats to give everyone sort of an exotic cat that's not quite wild. To me, that's a pretty shady thing to do. These are truly wild animals, great hunters out in the wild. They shouldn't be put in cages. They absolutely shouldn't be diluted down with domestic cat DNA. That's not what they were made to be. And here at Big Cat Rescue, of course, our philosophy is these animals belong in the wild, and the only way that we can ever accomplish that is if we preserve enough habitat in the \nComment: @maccrazyg5 I'm 100% sure of what I mean when I say without a doubt that tigers cannot be tamed.

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: Why you never had a \"Tiger Species Spotlight??\" That's weird.

Here is a normal sized croc. And here is Maximus. Estimated to be between 6 and 7 metres in length. As you can imagine, he is very good at intimidating his rivals. He is rarely seen on the bank, probably because of his massive size. This area of the Ord River is adjacent to many cattle properties. Seen here is a helicopter doing a survey, possibly checking how many of their cattle are still alive. Often crocodiles are seen grouped together. Here you can see four crocodiles hanging around in the one spot. Recently a local cattle station reported that they lose one to two cows per day to crocodile attacks. And with the sheer numbers of crocodiles I have seen in this area, I have no doubt. This has been Jeremy Rook, crocstalker.com. Thanks for watching. Please subscribe to my channel.

I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: @1HarryH Amazing place for sure!

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: I was having goofy smile upon clicking the title but when I saw that Flavio had passed away, it just faded. He's lived longer than I and I'm glad that he was having wonderful years with you guys. Thank you for taking care and loving our lovely Big Cats."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: And this is the work of the master builder among bower birds. I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: damn, that's impressive."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

There were a few notices put up by the hotel indicating that wild animals are not to be fed. Since this squirrel looked rather tame and more familiar with the surroundings I thought of giving it a banana :) May be it was used to the hotel guests feeding it. I was very close and was able to admire it while it was feeding itself. The surrounding of the resort hotel chalet where we stayed was rather interior and was bordering a Wildlife Sanctuary. Grizzled Giant Squirrel - (Ratufa Macroura) ================================= The grizzled giant squirrel is a large tree squirrel found in the highlands of Sri Lanka and India. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as near threatened due to habitat loss and hunting. Countries - Native - India , Sri Lanka Taxonomic Notes - There are three very distinct subspecies, with one present in India and all three present in Sri Lanka. Red List Category & Criteria - Near Threatened Justification - Listed as Near Threatened because this species is probably in significant decline due to habitat loss and hunting throughout much of its range. Range Description - This species is endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. In India it is known from only five severely fragmented locations, while it occurs more widely and less fragmented in Sri Lanka. Population - The Indian population has been estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals, and the population has been decling due to habitat loss and hunting The population of this species is considerably higher in Sri Lanka. Habitat and Ecology - It is a diurnal and arboreal species. It occurs in tropical dry deciduous and montane forests, where it is confined to the riverine habitats. It has a generation time of ~7-8 years. Major Threats- Habitat loss and degradation due to agro-industry farming, small-scale logging, selective logging, increase in human settlements, forest fire, inter-specific competition, competition from alien species, hunting for local consumption purposes, presence of domestic predators have been observed to be the major threats for this species. The grizzled giant squirrel's common name came from the grey to brown colouration highlighted with white at the top of the tail, giving it a grizzled appearance. The rest of the body varies in colour geographically and may be brown, red, grey or black, but the fur on the underside is always lighter than the back. This agile climber is adapted for life spent almost entirely in the trees, and has a very long tail for balance, broad hands for climbing and large claws for gripping branches. The ears are short, round and sometimes tufted.Music By Lohstana David from Jamendo .com\nTranscript: \nComment: @ClaireWerkB Thank you very much for your wonderful comments my dear  :0) Yes indeed ,to get food they will do anything :))\nHave a bright and peaceful week ahead !"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Tiger Shed Bobcat Box Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: So what's the story on this cat? Okay, this cat is at a place called a rescue farm, which apparently is a chain of rescues in Florida. I think there's three other ones, and they specialize in horses and small animals. And they have this tiger, the lady who, I don't know if she founded it or she was at least the permit holder there, is now hospitalized and doesn't have a good outlook. And one of the things that you can never plan for when you own a tiger is, you know, the inevitability of you're getting old. And the lady who owns Tigger is actually a patient in that hospital, right across the street. She's unable to take care of the cat. Hopefully that wasn't her. She's unable to take care of the cat, and it's left in the hands of people who don't know what they're doing, and more importantly, they don't have a license. Scary. They actually had a cougar, and they have a tiger, and a bobcat there. And the cougar has died, and the tiger is inside of a shed, and in a chain-link enclosure, and it has both sides of this, basically just a dog kennel. And they used to take her, when she was younger, they would take her to retirement homes to visit the elderly, and she walked on a leash everywhere. And of course, like everyone, everything else, when they get too big, that stops. The rescue farm has been sold to new owners, which are going to continue, but just in the capacity of smaller horses and smaller animals, like pocket pet type animals. The tiger's got to go. There'll be no permit holder on the property, and the bobcat's got to go. But as far as the tiger goes, none of who we label the bad guys want this tiger, because she has been spayed. And when I saw her last time, she is absolutely one of the most beautiful, big, just from appearance, Siberian tigers that I've ever seen. And she's been declawed and spayed, so she's of not much value for the breeder, so they don't want her. And basically, it puts Fish and Wildlife in a position where this tiger has nowhere to go, and they have no one that will take it, so the only thing they can do is euthanize it. And it's, you know, it's a lot of money. She's only six years old, so we're looking at probably 14-15 years of huge food bills, vet bills, and as always, you know, it's people that meant well in the beginning, but situations change, as they always do, and there's nowhere for it to go. It's been in this shed for at least three years since it's been outside and seen the sunlight, and when I saw it the first time, it was straining to climb the chain link to look outside and actually get a glimpse of the outside world. So it would be awesome to give this girl a good life. So this cat has never had, like, I mean, in the past three years, like, fresh air, or seen the outside, or anything? No, not at all. And before that, she only went outside on a leash, so it's not like she ever had an outdoor enclosure, or that she ever got to swim and run on grass and have any sort of life. So it's essentially, this has been it for her, but she's huge. She's about 600 pounds. She's a big tiger. And didn't you tell me that the other side of the kennel that she now has, the double side too, that the other side was where the cougar was living for initially, so she's only had half of that space? Absolutely, she's only had half of that space, and you know, there's just, just looking at it, you kind of cringe because there's tire swings hanging in there, stuff that she could get hurt on, and I don't know how. I mean, it's Florida. They hose that thing out. I don't know if she's ever dry, if that concrete is ever dry. And with her being declawed in the front, we know, we know what declawed cats end up looking like when they're on concrete. And this lady that's in the hospital, she's, you know, all she can think of, she's really not with it anymore, and she knows, she's just so emotionally attached to this tiger, and it's the same thing as we just saw in this chimp attack. She recently lost her husband and her own mother, and she's just projecting all of her hopes on this cat, and she's so devastated at the thought of giving it up that it's very, very hard for her. You know, it's just, it's such a reality check. She's never, ever gonna be able to take care of animals again, and you know, she's never gonna be able to afford animals again, and yet she's still worried. Her big concern is, is giving up her license to own these animals. She has concerns that that would somehow prevent her from ever working with animals again, and it's that, and that's, that's honestly her reality. She, you know, it sounds like if she's in liver failure, she may not even ever live outside of a hospital again, and yet, still in the back of her mind, that's bothering her, that she might have to give up that permit to own these kind of animals. And you see that all the time, where it's more about what the people feel like they're losing. It's not about what's best for the animal, it's about them, and it shouldn't be about them. Now, the cool part is the two ladies, the mother and daughter, that work there, that are taking care of this cat, they know that it's wrong, and they, they feel terrible. And again, I, you know, it's, I just think in their mind, they're doing everything they can, and they know it's not right. And when I talked to them, they, they almost seemed embarrassed, like they're ashamed of being part of this cat, but yet when they talk about her, they want to just, you know, they want to go in with her, they want to hug her, they just think of her. There's even a sign that says she's just a big house cat, and they just don't get it. They don't get it. And I mean, thankfully, this is honestly one of the most mild-mannered tigers I have ever seen, which is a good thing, because they'd probably both be dead by now. Do they go in with her? They, they say, they say that they don't, and they say that they don't take her out on the leash anymore, because they don't have, they're not legally licensed to own her. But, good Lord. That's the only reason? When I was there, they surely just opened that door, right, and tried to call her over there. Okay, I'm staying in the car for that one. And then when they saw how I reacted, oh, she won't come out, I said, yeah. Favorite last words. Yeah, exactly. And how does the owner justify this cat being in this shed? That's, that's not how she sees it. She sees that as, as part of what makes her complete, and that that's just a temporary situation. They always, you know, they always have grandiose plans that we're gonna have this huge outdoor enclosure with waterfalls, and caves, and huge swimming pools, and that's exactly what they told me. Well, the plan was to enclose a whole acre for her, and have a waterfall every time. You could probably, that, isn't that a broken record? Every time. Every one of these sanctuary sites that you go to has these incredible multi-million dollar plans of how they're gonna be taking care of these animals someday. If somebody would just send them the money, and when people do send them the money, it ends up going to salaries, it doesn't, they get more animals. But this is three years in the making still. Well, you know what, Barbara, when I asked them, because they said, well, she used to go outside all the time, and she used to do this, I said, well, honestly, when was the last time she's been outside? And they both kind of looked at each other, and they tried to figure it out in their heads, and then they were both, I mean, really hurt that it was three years. I don't think it even crossed their mind how long she had been in that shed. It's horrifying, and they, and I mean, the area is lined with cages with raccoons, and foxes, and chinchillas, and ferrets, and all these other animals in tiny, tiny cages, and then they have a piece of tape on the floor, because school kids come out there and take care of the little animals, and it's just, there's a piece of red tape that they know if you step over that line, you're too close to the tiger. Kids, school kids, elementary kids, and yet that's all that the state requires.\nComment: Hi, if you would like to help us get the laws changed visit our website bigcatrescue*org and look under catlaws!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

Finally breaking the camera out again and decided to walk some land in search of sheds, enjoy!\nTranscript: Hey guys, what's up? It's Champlea7. I know I haven't made a video in a super long time, but my camera is actually out of commission right now. I left it at my buddy's house and I haven't seen him for about two months. I went on a hog hunt with him, so I'm using my buddy, the Texas Bone Hunters video camera. And I'm back here on a wildlife management area today near my house in Dallas, Texas. It's about 15 minutes from my house and there's got to be a couple thousand acres back here I'm thinking. I mean, there is just a ton of land to come in here and I mean, I'm kind of just trail hopping right now. I'm doing a shed hunting video today. It's January the 27th or the 28th, one of the two days, Saturday, but I'm back here ready to find some sheds, hopefully bring you guys a quality video, so stay tuned. Well, guys, I know you're probably watching this video to get a couple of shed hunting information from me, so I'm going to share some with you right now, guys. First thing, this is a really new area to me. I really haven't come back here a lot. I've come back here to do a little bit of bow fishing. You might have seen some of my bow fishing videos, but I noticed a lot of the land that was back from where I bow fish is a wildlife management area, so that's why I'm in here today. This is really my first time in here and what you want to do, you really want to pick apart your cover whenever you're shed hunting. Look for any sort of geographic region that might hold deer more, like openings within some really heavily wooded forests. Look for a sign. Keep away from those areas that are devoid of signs. Try not to trail hop. I'm really guilty of doing that a lot. I do get lucky sometimes trail hopping, but you could probably find a lot more if you look for a sign. I've got a rub right here in front of me. These deer in Texas actually rut around late December into January, so I know that this is probably kind of fresh and there's some deer hanging around here, but I know a lot of bucks still haven't shed right now, especially here in the Lone Star State because we're so far south. It's really not a hard winter on these deer, so I'm really looking for older sheds maybe. Just anything that might be in here. There's a ton of woods. There's no way someone's covered at all, so I'm going to try to get a couple finds. So stick around. Hey guys, the Texas bone hunter is over here. He's found some bone. Let's see what he's got. He's probably already picked it up here. Man, this is some thick stuff. I can't believe deer are walking through here. Yeah, I know. That is a very nice shed. Was it laying right there? Well, yeah. I mean, it's not even chewed up or anything, dude. Yeah. That's an awesome shed. It's all... Yeah, it's in very good condition. Very good condition. I don't know how long I've been wanting to find a shed for myself, dude, now. Yeah? I'm so pumped. So it was right here, huh? Yeah. Wow. Very nice. Well guys, just found this bad boy right here. Little boar, it looks like. Pretty good cutters on him, actually. This spot of the woods back here is definitely dominated by pigs. You can just tell it's all tore up in here and pigs everywhere. But I found the bottom skull and then found the top skull not even 5 or 10 yards away from it. Pretty easy find and a pretty cool thing to add to my collection. So we're starting to hit some bone here now, whether it be skull or actual sheds. We'll keep in tune, guys, so stay with us. Hey guys, just found my first antler here. I haven't even gone to pick it up yet. I'm going to do an ATL picture of it with my phone and on the camera. But I am excited. It looks really good. I'm about 15 yards away from it right now. So let's go see it. Oh man. Wow, that's a good shed. Ha. Guys, we're on some wildlife management area land here. In Texas. And by God, he's got a split brow. It's pretty nice. A G2 and G3 and he's pretty chunky for being back here. Man. Well, that's awesome. I'm glad we got one, guys. I'm ready to go find some more. Oh my God. Wow. Alright. I ain't kidding you guys right now. I just want to do a walking away shot with this shed. And there's another shed not even laying 10 yards away. Right on the same trail. Looks to be pretty old. So there's some more. Shed's obviously to be found. Keep watching, guys. Wow. Alright, guys. What I'm doing now is what's called gridding. After finding those two antlers, there's a pretty good chance that the other one's going to be pretty close by. So what you want to do is wherever you found that antler, just kind of go back and forth. Help you use landmarks. And trying to find the other side. Basically making a big sweep where you can't miss it. You're not trail hopping. You're doing more of a systematic search. So stay with me. And I'll check in if I get anything. Thanks for watching!\nComment: @fishnkid1923 That's a great question man! hahah, and I'll have my camera back this upcoming weekend so another one probably in 2 weeks!

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: And this is the work of the master builder among bower birds. I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: Absolutely cool!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: I love how you guys provide such love for these animals; they deserve every bit of it <3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

There's a lot of blood on the ground, we're not sure whether it's because he's been running on the concrete or he's got an injury. Because he's down we're going to try to see if we can get to a point where we can get this little jab stick over him and get it into him because we know he'll then go to sleep very quickly. But it's not the easiest thing and they usually don't stand it, but it will save us having to try to catch him. Right, that was the end of that one. Absolutely screwed the needle. Okay, didn't work people. He's quite calm at the moment, but he could so easily jump over that fence just back and forth. Sean's got him really well contained, he's just very steady behind him keeping him calm. But we don't know where he's going to go from. Well, that was a much more sedate rescue than it might have been. The wound on his flank is very old, he's done it a long time ago. We can put a bit of gel on that and maybe give him an antibiotic. It's really old, it's healed. We just need to see where all this blood's coming from. I think the blood's from his hooves. These have bled and you can see where he's gone backwards and forwards across that end part. He's got a cut on either eye as well. That's old. This side's not quite so old. He's been in the wars a bit. He has. These are all really old injuries, they're completely dry. I've got the antlers protected so he can't do you any damage, will he? OK, I'm ready. OK, let's go on. Come on, fella. Steady. Get Lucy's expression well, Andy. No, don't. OK, we good? Well, the deer's here. Didn't have to walk very far. I'm not sure whether Lucy's ever going to walk again. She looks absolutely knackered. But he's ready to go. He's gorgeous. Straight into woodland from this field. He shouldn't go back towards the school, so he's on his own again for his second chance. We're looking at him probably as third or fourth chance, to be honest. Right, OK. And off you go, fella. Relaxed, wasn't he? He's really looking good. Just toddling off at his own pace, really. I'm in no rush. I'm back home. She's actually had five minutes to recover. But you can tell how unfit our vet nurse is, can't you? She might be good at her job. Get her to walk 200 yards and she's... Look at it. You're so naughty. If I hadn't had what I had, you'd have got an antler in the face.\nComment: SoS team hey save the poor deer.. \nDeer being a gang member having cool tattoos being total badass thinks oh not again.."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: Oh I can see why you said this is a delight to see!

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Tiger Shed Bobcat Box Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: So what's the story on this cat? Okay, this cat is at a place called a rescue farm, which apparently is a chain of rescues in Florida. I think there's three other ones, and they specialize in horses and small animals. And they have this tiger, the lady who, I don't know if she founded it or she was at least the permit holder there, is now hospitalized and doesn't have a good outlook. And one of the things that you can never plan for when you own a tiger is, you know, the inevitability of you're getting old. And the lady who owns Tigger is actually a patient in that hospital, right across the street. She's unable to take care of the cat. Hopefully that wasn't her. She's unable to take care of the cat, and it's left in the hands of people who don't know what they're doing, and more importantly, they don't have a license. Scary. They actually had a cougar, and they have a tiger, and a bobcat there. And the cougar has died, and the tiger is inside of a shed, and in a chain-link enclosure, and it has both sides of this, basically just a dog kennel. And they used to take her, when she was younger, they would take her to retirement homes to visit the elderly, and she walked on a leash everywhere. And of course, like everyone, everything else, when they get too big, that stops. The rescue farm has been sold to new owners, which are going to continue, but just in the capacity of smaller horses and smaller animals, like pocket pet type animals. The tiger's got to go. There'll be no permit holder on the property, and the bobcat's got to go. But as far as the tiger goes, none of who we label the bad guys want this tiger, because she has been spayed. And when I saw her last time, she is absolutely one of the most beautiful, big, just from appearance, Siberian tigers that I've ever seen. And she's been declawed and spayed, so she's of not much value for the breeder, so they don't want her. And basically, it puts Fish and Wildlife in a position where this tiger has nowhere to go, and they have no one that will take it, so the only thing they can do is euthanize it. And it's, you know, it's a lot of money. She's only six years old, so we're looking at probably 14-15 years of huge food bills, vet bills, and as always, you know, it's people that meant well in the beginning, but situations change, as they always do, and there's nowhere for it to go. It's been in this shed for at least three years since it's been outside and seen the sunlight, and when I saw it the first time, it was straining to climb the chain link to look outside and actually get a glimpse of the outside world. So it would be awesome to give this girl a good life. So this cat has never had, like, I mean, in the past three years, like, fresh air, or seen the outside, or anything? No, not at all. And before that, she only went outside on a leash, so it's not like she ever had an outdoor enclosure, or that she ever got to swim and run on grass and have any sort of life. So it's essentially, this has been it for her, but she's huge. She's about 600 pounds. She's a big tiger. And didn't you tell me that the other side of the kennel that she now has, the double side too, that the other side was where the cougar was living for initially, so she's only had half of that space? Absolutely, she's only had half of that space, and you know, there's just, just looking at it, you kind of cringe because there's tire swings hanging in there, stuff that she could get hurt on, and I don't know how. I mean, it's Florida. They hose that thing out. I don't know if she's ever dry, if that concrete is ever dry. And with her being declawed in the front, we know, we know what declawed cats end up looking like when they're on concrete. And this lady that's in the hospital, she's, you know, all she can think of, she's really not with it anymore, and she knows, she's just so emotionally attached to this tiger, and it's the same thing as we just saw in this chimp attack. She recently lost her husband and her own mother, and she's just projecting all of her hopes on this cat, and she's so devastated at the thought of giving it up that it's very, very hard for her. You know, it's just, it's such a reality check. She's never, ever gonna be able to take care of animals again, and you know, she's never gonna be able to afford animals again, and yet she's still worried. Her big concern is, is giving up her license to own these animals. She has concerns that that would somehow prevent her from ever working with animals again, and it's that, and that's, that's honestly her reality. She, you know, it sounds like if she's in liver failure, she may not even ever live outside of a hospital again, and yet, still in the back of her mind, that's bothering her, that she might have to give up that permit to own these kind of animals. And you see that all the time, where it's more about what the people feel like they're losing. It's not about what's best for the animal, it's about them, and it shouldn't be about them. Now, the cool part is the two ladies, the mother and daughter, that work there, that are taking care of this cat, they know that it's wrong, and they, they feel terrible. And again, I, you know, it's, I just think in their mind, they're doing everything they can, and they know it's not right. And when I talked to them, they, they almost seemed embarrassed, like they're ashamed of being part of this cat, but yet when they talk about her, they want to just, you know, they want to go in with her, they want to hug her, they just think of her. There's even a sign that says she's just a big house cat, and they just don't get it. They don't get it. And I mean, thankfully, this is honestly one of the most mild-mannered tigers I have ever seen, which is a good thing, because they'd probably both be dead by now. Do they go in with her? They, they say, they say that they don't, and they say that they don't take her out on the leash anymore, because they don't have, they're not legally licensed to own her. But, good Lord. That's the only reason? When I was there, they surely just opened that door, right, and tried to call her over there. Okay, I'm staying in the car for that one. And then when they saw how I reacted, oh, she won't come out, I said, yeah. Favorite last words. Yeah, exactly. And how does the owner justify this cat being in this shed? That's, that's not how she sees it. She sees that as, as part of what makes her complete, and that that's just a temporary situation. They always, you know, they always have grandiose plans that we're gonna have this huge outdoor enclosure with waterfalls, and caves, and huge swimming pools, and that's exactly what they told me. Well, the plan was to enclose a whole acre for her, and have a waterfall every time. You could probably, that, isn't that a broken record? Every time. Every one of these sanctuary sites that you go to has these incredible multi-million dollar plans of how they're gonna be taking care of these animals someday. If somebody would just send them the money, and when people do send them the money, it ends up going to salaries, it doesn't, they get more animals. But this is three years in the making still. Well, you know what, Barbara, when I asked them, because they said, well, she used to go outside all the time, and she used to do this, I said, well, honestly, when was the last time she's been outside? And they both kind of looked at each other, and they tried to figure it out in their heads, and then they were both, I mean, really hurt that it was three years. I don't think it even crossed their mind how long she had been in that shed. It's horrifying, and they, and I mean, the area is lined with cages with raccoons, and foxes, and chinchillas, and ferrets, and all these other animals in tiny, tiny cages, and then they have a piece of tape on the floor, because school kids come out there and take care of the little animals, and it's just, there's a piece of red tape that they know if you step over that line, you're too close to the tiger. Kids, school kids, elementary kids, and yet that's all that the state requires.\nComment: What is the status of these poor cats?

The cats' efforts were captured by high-definition and slow-motion cameras for the Saving a Species series for teachers.Subscribe to our channel on YouTube:  to our print magazine:  our Blog:  us on Twitter:  a fan on Facebook:  our TV show: \nTranscript: Today we're shooting an episode of Shamu TV. It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection.

Listen to Master Keeper Barbara Frank talk about Dances and Canadian Lynx in the wild.Image of Canadian Lynx in trap courtesy of:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: This is Dances with Wolves, Big Cat Rescue's resident Canadian lynx. She's also one of the oldest cats at the sanctuary. She'll be turning 19 in July. The name lynx comes from the Greek word to shine, which is probably in reference to the reflective ability of the cat's eyes. The Canadian lynx looks very similar to its cousin, the Siberian lynx. Their dense fur ranges in color from a reddish brown to gray. They have a flared facial ruff, black ear tufts, and long hind legs with a short tail. Their large, widespread feet are covered in fur, which act as snowshoes and are effective in supporting the cat's weight on the snow. They are often confused with their smaller feline cousin, the bobcat, but can be easily distinguished by their tail tips. The tail of the lynx looks as though it was dipped in an inkwell, being black all the way around, whereas the bobcat's tail appears to have been painted black on top and white on the bottom. They are larger on average than the bobcat, yet vary less in size, so the largest bobcats can outsize the lynx. Canadian lynx are found in the northern forests across almost all of Canada and Alaska, as well as in certain parts of North America. They're a secretive and mostly nocturnal animal, although they may be active at any time of the day. Unlike any other species of cat, the lynx depends almost exclusively on the snowshoe hare. No other predator has such a strong cyclic prey base to which it has become uniquely adapted. The snowshoe hare population peaks every 10 years, and with it, so does the lynx population. While lynx will change their prey base when hares are low to include rodents, birds, larger prey such as deer, the overall lynx population is still synchronous with the hare population. The greatest threat to the Canadian lynx is being trapped for their fur, and when this is done during low numbers, it makes recovery of the population extremely difficult. And of course, just like all the other wild species of cats, destruction of their habitat by humans is also a big concern. Dances with Wolves was rescued from a game farm. Game farms are places where exotic animals are bred for photography and filming. These animals are often drugged and chained in place and surrounded by props that resemble their natural habitat. These are many of the photos that you see on calendars and in commercials. To find out more, visit our website, bigcatrescue.org.

The lionesses haven't made a successful kill in days. All three are producing milk. They need to replenish their reserves. Kali splits off from the pride, while mother and Ani hide the cubs. She heads to a narrow island that sits just above the water table. In winter, grass above the water line dries out. It's perfect camouflage for a tawny coat. And dry ground is the lechwe's achilles heel, the long hooves that make them fast in the water slow them down on terra firma. The lioness can clock nearly 40 miles per hour on hard ground, but she can only sprint for 100 yards. She has to close the gap between them before she attacks. Kali's impatient. She closes in too fast. The lechwe uses the head start to bolt for the water. Again, the swamp defeats her.\nComment: was evolution drunk and high or sometihng when it designed those legs? slowing a land animal on land to make it faster when running in water?

I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: \"Pimp My Bower\". Man I wish this bird was my flatmate, we'd be scoring all the chicks!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: THANK YOU for watching.

Up backpacking with the kids and brother-in-laws Uncle Bingo and I had a close encounter with a Bull Moose. Returning to the car to gather extra gear for the kids at dusk, turned a bend on the trail and a bull moose was not too far off. I was in his comfort zone and he let me know it. Some very raw footage and just a snapshot of the trip. Also, Bingo and I having some fun talking about the youtube series \"Guy on a Buffalo.\" Personally I find it funny.Please visit \nTranscript: Let me set up this video for you. So I went backpacking, well, if you want to call it backpacking, with my kids, my brother-in-laws and their kids. Because we had so many young kids with us, we actually didn't go in very far at all. But we went in, found a spot, dropped all our stuff, and some of the adults stayed with the kids, and me and Uncle Bingo, actually, you've seen him in my films before, we went back down to the car to get the rest of the sleeping bags and that kind of stuff. But what happened is, I actually went down first. I kind of bushwhacked a little bit, you guys know how I like that, and then I hooked up with a trail later, and I was just, oh, I don't know, probably 50 yards ahead of him. And as I'm walking down, I'm almost to the street, and I notice a car was parked on the street right where our cars were parked, and it was just sitting there. I'm thinking, what is that car doing? As I walk and I come around this tree, I look over and there's a nice big old bull moose. And he's, well, he's not huge, but he's sitting there and he sees me come around the corner, he stops and he looks at me. And then my brother-in-law, Uncle Bingo, starts coming behind me, and I tell him to kind of be quiet because I want to get some film of this guy, and I kind of wave him over. But one thing I always talk about is looking for body language, and you're going to see it in this one. One of the signs of aggression that moose exhibit when you are in their space is they will often lower their heads, their ears will lay back on their heads. And then this guy, he started a beeline right at me. Now, what to look for here is, the first thing I did when I saw him, I thought, yeah, we're kind of close, but I'll be honest, you get a camera in my hand and all I'm thinking about is getting a shot. So I get my camera out, and when he starts coming at me, I'll edit this so it's kid-friendly. But I actually switched the camera to my left hand so that I could get my Glock 27 out of my ribs pack with my right, but it was just very sloppy because I'm trying to film him and I'm trying to get my gun out and I'm trying to watch him all at the same time. And anyway, I'll have you take a look at this, it's kind of fun. So of course, this is when I first see him. I get the camera right out of the pack. He hasn't seen me yet, but then he turns right here, bam, he sees me. Now it doesn't take him long, lower his head, see him lower his ears. Now, at this point, for some reason, I go into a weird accent and I'm trying to fish my Glock 27 out. Although I do have some good footage of you. Not really because it's so shaky. I think we're just kind of right in his way, there he goes, he's alright. Now what ensues here is me and Uncle Bingo just really enjoying the experience and talking about it, and it's very raw footage guys, it's just kind of a snapshot of this trip and a very unpolished snapshot of that. Is there two of them? Oh yeah, there is. Is it a bull or is it a cow? The thing is, is we're getting into rut season. And that means they get pretty ornery. Not quite though, but close. Looks like they're just doing their thing, I love this man, jeez. Good thing you stopped me, I came charging down the trail, making all kinds of sounds to scare bears, but. Uncle Bingo of course. You would have just took me out. I mean the cars are just right there, that's where the road is. And the bull moose and what we think is a cow. And we're pretty dang close to that bull moose right now. Let's see if I can... He's just right there, he's watching us. He's okay. He's alright. They really blend in if you're not watching. Yeah, they do don't they? As big as they are. Okay, this is what we're going to do. I'm going to film you. You run up, slap his butt, or spray paint it, and run as fast as you can. I'll tape the whole thing, this will be great YouTube footage. This will be like missing the Sasquatch a little bit. Okay, I'm in. Okay. We just forced him in the brush. Now see, I can't tell if he's eating or maybe... Look at this, maybe this is his bed. He's like, hey buddy. Get away from my bed. This is about as close as I dare get. We're probably 20 feet apart with a lot of brush in between us. He seems pretty calm. He's just gone about his business eating again. That's one thing I do, is really watch their body language. And understand where you are too. I know a lot of you guys tell me... I've had several guys in Alaska tell me, you could never do this. In Alaska with the moose that they have. Sorry guys, I'm not filming too well right now. I'm more watching him than trying to film him. Hey look, there's a baby. Awesome. Put him in your pack. What? Got straight up mauled by a cougar. Got on a buffalo. Buffalo sounds. We're approaching moose territory again. And this is our strategy. We've got plenty of sleeping bags. So if he charges us, we use the sleeping bag as a shield, punch him, wrestle him down, hog tie him. Good to go. I could do a drop kick to knock him over. That would be cool. We need to set up the camera though, so we can get it all on tape. Where's your action camera? Do you see that one? The bear one? That's freaking hilarious. He's right there, hanging out. He's the guy in the hat with the cool hat. Knock your hat, but it's not going to save you. Where he knocks the stove over. Knock the stove over on your foot. Ouch.\nComment: I had never heard of \"Guy on a Buffalo\" before until I watched this video. So I searched for it (on YouTube of course) and I couldn't stop laughing. Thanks for sharing that with us.

Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: I ran into a large bear (It was brown in color, at least on the back, but it must have been a black bear) on the back side of Cascade in '92 or so.  We had stopped to pick some berries in a ravine, and noticed we weren't the only ones enjoying the harvest.  It was at the top of the ravine maybe 15 yards away gingerly eating the berries.  I motioned to my buddy, and we both silently agreed he needed the berries more then we did.  We slowly backed up and took the long way around (I now know that was probably not the best strategy, but it worked).  The bear never seemed to notice us.  Since then I had a chance to see many larger Brown Bears even closer at the Katmai bear camp in Alaska, which was awesome, but somehow running into that bear in Utah stands out in my mind."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Hair sheep My family's hair sheep eating away the black berry and brush.\nTranscript: Hello everybody, I thought I would do something different today and do a sheep video. Hare sheep is what they are, get away from rabbits for a little bit. Anyway, these are the hare sheep, here comes Shelby, she's an Anatolian Marema Lifestyle Guardian dog and she's just a little bit over a year old. She keeps the sheep safe in here, come here Shelby, come here girl, good girl. We used to lose sheep to the coyotes out here and ever since we got her, come here Shelby, come girl, she's really kept an eye out on them. It's real fun to watch her because right about 4 in the afternoon when it starts getting dark, she'll go ahead and walk the fence line. She's definitely keeping the coyotes out, they had multiple holes along the fence line. It's about 5 acres in here and it's mostly all blackberry. All this right here that's all cleared out used to look like what's over there on the other side of the fence, sheep can't get to that so that's all overgrown. That's what it looked like and this is what it looks like over here now and they still have a lot to go. Right now, they're eating some hay, some orchard grass and these hare sheep, there's a few different breeds in here and I'll go through them here. This one here that's looking back at us, she's a Catan-Dorper cross and there's a few of those. Most of all the white ones are Catan-Dorper and that guy right there in the middle, he's a breeding ram, that white one and that's one of the breeding rams and the one right next to him that's got the little horns there, he just moved, he's another breeding ram. We keep two in here and that one that just poked her head out, she's a Dorper-Barbados black belly cross and this orange one here, she's a Catan. She's an orange Catan and the breeding ram, he's a white Catan and this little one that looks like deer with the black belly, they are the purebred American Barbados black belly and that one there with the black head, she's a Blackhead-Dorper. There's two of those and they're registered and papered and everything and this little guy here in the front, little red guy there, he is a Barbados cross. We don't know what his sire was, the previous ram that we had in here, he was sired by that one and we don't know what he was anyway. He's a pretty looking, he's a weather and these two rams here, they're unrelated to all of these ewes and most of all these ewes were born in December of last year or so they're about 11 months old so they're all coming into heat now and we'll probably have some spring lambs in March so I'll probably do a video of them so look forward to that. There's two black ones in the back or the dark colored ones back there, there's two of them, they're sisters. I don't know if I can get a good shot from this side of the fence but they're Columbian Shetland cross, there she is, poked her head right in the middle of those and hair sheep you don't need to shear them, doctor tails or trim their hooves, they're very low maintenance, they're good for brush eating, for pets and for meat as well. They're gaining a lot of popularity out here in the northwest, they're very popular out in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, parts of California, Mexico and Central America and South America and down south of Mexico they call them the Pelebues, so they're nice animals to keep, they're very lean, mild taste and they are nowhere near as stinky as goats and they have very good mothering instincts, so they're easy keepers these guys, that's why we like them. Some of these have their tails docked just for the look really, usually you want to dock the tails on wool sheep because of the maggots get stuck back there, causes the animal to get sick and then die, but because these animals have hair, it's not like a horse or a cow or a dog, it's not going to get stuck back there in the wool, but we do it just for the look, I think they look nice with their tails docked, they've really done a good job of clearing this up out here. There's another breed of hair sheep, they're called St. Croix, they're from the island of St. Thomas and they're even more parasite resistant, they don't get to be as meaty, they're still pretty nice animals. And then there's a few other hair sheep, I forget what the names of the breeds are. That's the video, hope you guys enjoyed it, if you have any questions or comments, post them up, and if you haven't subscribed, subscribe, you're welcome to, and we'll catch you next time.\nComment: I had some cattle panels and green metal fence posts that I used to temp fence areas like that lush growth behind the area you have them in. I could take it up and move it around easily and hammer in the posts with my soft ground I had. I rotated them around, cross fencing, and they had forage almost all year (Southeast Texas). I had a couple too many for the areas they worked, so I did provide some hay and some feed for mine on a regular basis, too. \n\nThey cleaned their areas up to about five feet high of low branches. I had barbados. I loved them. Beautiful quiet lawn mowers and tree trimmers. They kept it very nice around the pond and kept all the fence rows clean. \n\nSince this was from 2011, they likely have cleared all your land by now, though. \n\nThat barbado cross you had there was certainly a beautiful animal."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The bucks are the ones with the brown on their heads - the brown is staining from tree bark as they rub their antlers on trees.  They will be snow white again when they shed their winter coats.  They are not regulars in our neck of the woods so we didn't have the opportunity to see them with their antlers.  We sure would have loved to.  We did get a brief glimpse of the old buck with his wide, palmated antlers.  It seems that as the albino bucks age their antlers get thicker & thicker.

Here, plants can't get water not because it's frozen, but because rain hardly ever falls, only about one or two inches in the whole year. Most of the time, it's bone dry and devastatingly hot. Yet, almost unbelievably, there are trees standing out in the sands, totally unsheltered, with no sign of moisture anywhere around them. Water storage is the great trick here. These green succulent leaves are full of it, and so are these bloated branches. The local bushmen used to cut off these branches and hollow out the spongy tissue and use them as containers for their arrows, which is why this tree is called the quiver tree. Its branches are covered with a blindingly white powder which reflects the heat, and its leaves have thick rinds with very few pores, which minimizes the amount of water they lose through evaporation. The trunk, even of an old tree ravaged by the years, remains smooth and impermeable, but even the quiver tree can't seal itself off totally from its surroundings. Living involves breathing, and some water vapour is inevitably lost in that process. But this tree has a way of reducing that. Self-amputation. It can cut off a leaf rosette and seal the stump. This branch will never grow leaves again, but with luck, the tree will just survive with a reduced number of leaves and put out new shoots when conditions improve.\nComment: What’s happening igs biology"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They suspect that poachers killed their mother for her pelt. At first, everyone thinks they're leopard cubs. It turns out they're the rarest of finds. Two clouded leopard cubs. The find captures the imagination of top Indian wildlife photographer Sandesh Kadur. Cats have always fascinated me, and when I heard about these clouded leopards being rehabilitated back into the wild, I dropped everything and rushed to the spot to document the whole process. In terms of filming a new species of cat, I mean, this was it. This is the holy grail. Clouded leopards are amazing creatures, the smallest of the big cats. Shy and elusive, even cat specialists know little about their habits in the wild. Just keeping them alive is a big challenge. A leading vet, Dr. Bhaskar Chowdhury, takes charge of caring for these very special cubs. That was the first experience for me to see wild clouded leopard cubs for the first time in my life. So I was really excited and also a bit nervous because the onus is on us, the veterinarians, to make them survive. Bhaskar is determined that the cubs don't end up in the zoo like most orphaned big cats. He gets permission to try something totally unprecedented, to teach clouded leopard cubs how to be wild. It's totally new, never been tried, never been tested, and people, you know, many scientists won't believe this. It's a huge gamble. If his new protocol succeeds, it will boost dwindling numbers of clouded leopards in their real home, the forest. If they get it wrong, the cubs will die.\nComment: apparently, you're supposed to let a momma house cat raise em and keep human contact down to an absolute minimum.\notherwise they grow up without a healthy fear of humans."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

I guess, I never showed you guys that at the other campground. Anyway, this is a nice campground. And look, grass, not dirt. The campground that we stayed at last weekend, it was all dirt. Every single campsite was dirt. Which is just crazy. So, we're getting ready to head on the road. Head on the road. We're gonna head on the road? Head on the road. Whatever. So, we just left the campground and we are headed to Oswald's Bear Ranch. They have the north, I think the largest collection of black bears, is it? Probably. Largest collection of black bears in the United States. Or at least like on this side of the United States. Cause we were at a black bear ranch one time out west and they had a lot of bears too. I think they had a large collection of bears though, not just black bears. Yeah, I think they had like grizzly bears. Yeah, they had a Kodiak. I remember that. And this guy just has just black bears. So, we're gonna go see some bears. Not you girls. You girls are gonna have to sit in the car with the air conditioner on for a little bit. That's why we have two sets of keys. We're at the bear ranch. There's their dens. And way back there we see a bear. These are the female bears, I believe. There's a big bear right there. Just a walking. They just remind me of dogs. Imagine what it sounds like when they get all playing. Yeah. Probably like Shelby and Oakley. Yeah. Look a bear, panting just like the dogs. We don't have any apples. We didn't buy any apples yet. And don't look like he needs many apples. Pretty cool. What's up dude? What's up? Are you hot? I think these are the females he said. Yeah, and she looks like she could be pregnant.

Look how little she is. She's just a-walking. Looking for food. Here she goes. Looking away. Looking away. She makes a loop. And eyes. Boom. She's looking for an apple.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: It's usually 10-12 years in the wild, but in captivity with good care they can live to be 20+ years old, we had a cougar named Scratch who lived to be 29 years old!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5. Mention any of the information that I wrote about above or anything I may have forgotten.Remember, please be polite but state your case.  This is the only chance we have and time is ticking away.

The sanctuary is a permanent home to over 100 rescued big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards. As well as smaller species like bobcats, servals, and sand cats. Campers arrive every day and get to explore our 55 acre property, making sure they say hello to the cats and taking lots of photos along the way. While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this. We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life. Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans. They get to do lots of fun activities, like making Big Cat popsicles and learning about our operant conditioning program and why it's so important to the cats at the sanctuary. Then campers observe Big Cat keepers handing out the popsicles they made and the cats willingly participating in our operant conditioning program.

This footage was shot at beautiful Animal Kingdom (Disney) in Orlando, Fl.\nTranscript: The large flying fox is one of the biggest bats in the world. Even though it may weigh, on average, only two pounds, its wingspan can get to around six feet wide. That is one of the reasons this bat belongs to the suborder, megabat. Or as I say, the suborder, MEGABAT! These large bats are just one of many species of flying fox. They get their name due to their heads, which up close, sort of look like a fox with their pointed ears. These large flying fox come from the islands of Southeast Asia. They will roost high up in the trees and they will become active at sunrise and at sunset. So they aren't strictly nocturnal. And since they're considered an old world bat, they also can't echolocate like some other bats can. So they rely on their sense of smell and strong eyesight to locate food. Food for these large bats is pollen, leaves, flowers, and fruits. So you don't have to worry, they're not going to suck your blood. They play an important role where they can take fruit seeds from one island to another to help the fruits grow in new locations. Now unfortunately, they are often seen as pests since they eat flowers and they then are over hunted. These large flying foxes also need a lot of trees and in Southeast Asia, a lot of forests and jungles are being cut down due to the growing human population and a need for more space. The flying fox will usually give birth to just one pup so it's very important to conserve each and every large bat we see. Their young will stay with them for around 12 to 14 weeks and then they become mature enough to go out on their own. For more information on the flying fox, please read this video's description below. And as always, thanks for watching!\nComment: Such an informative video.

I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: This is so beautiful! I think it's my new favorite bird. :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: @heislukos Leading experts have estimated that if the rate of poaching continues this is how long tigers have in the wild before they are gone forever..."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They suspect that poachers killed their mother for her pelt. At first, everyone thinks they're leopard cubs. It turns out they're the rarest of finds. Two clouded leopard cubs. The find captures the imagination of top Indian wildlife photographer Sandesh Kadur. Cats have always fascinated me, and when I heard about these clouded leopards being rehabilitated back into the wild, I dropped everything and rushed to the spot to document the whole process. In terms of filming a new species of cat, I mean, this was it. This is the holy grail. Clouded leopards are amazing creatures, the smallest of the big cats. Shy and elusive, even cat specialists know little about their habits in the wild. Just keeping them alive is a big challenge. A leading vet, Dr. Bhaskar Chowdhury, takes charge of caring for these very special cubs. That was the first experience for me to see wild clouded leopard cubs for the first time in my life. So I was really excited and also a bit nervous because the onus is on us, the veterinarians, to make them survive. Bhaskar is determined that the cubs don't end up in the zoo like most orphaned big cats. He gets permission to try something totally unprecedented, to teach clouded leopard cubs how to be wild. It's totally new, never been tried, never been tested, and people, you know, many scientists won't believe this. It's a huge gamble. If his new protocol succeeds, it will boost dwindling numbers of clouded leopards in their real home, the forest. If they get it wrong, the cubs will die.\nComment: Aww man!

I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: another wonderful creature from God!\nso cool!:D"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: I'm on the southern edge of the Namib Desert. Here, plants can't get water not because it's frozen, but because rain hardly ever falls, only about one or two inches in the whole year. Most of the time, it's bone dry and devastatingly hot. Yet, almost unbelievably, there are trees standing out in the sands, totally unsheltered, with no sign of moisture anywhere around them. Water storage is the great trick here. These green succulent leaves are full of it, and so are these bloated branches. The local bushmen used to cut off these branches and hollow out the spongy tissue and use them as containers for their arrows, which is why this tree is called the quiver tree. Its branches are covered with a blindingly white powder which reflects the heat, and its leaves have thick rinds with very few pores, which minimizes the amount of water they lose through evaporation. The trunk, even of an old tree ravaged by the years, remains smooth and impermeable, but even the quiver tree can't seal itself off totally from its surroundings. Living involves breathing, and some water vapour is inevitably lost in that process. But this tree has a way of reducing that. Self-amputation. It can cut off a leaf rosette and seal the stump. This branch will never grow leaves again, but with luck, the tree will just survive with a reduced number of leaves and put out new shoots when conditions improve.\nComment: Self amputation!?\nOuch. ;<"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

And home to the Saltwater Crocodile. Abundant cattle and birdlife can be seen along its shores. And this provides an excellent food source for the Saltwater Crocodile. Crocodiles in this area are some of the largest seen anywhere in the world. With an estimated 20 crocodiles per kilometre of river, this truly is the land of the giants. Fights break out often in the crocodile world, usually for the best spot. Here it is in slow motion. Watch for the snap. Bam! Of course I went there to see the giant crocodiles. Here is a normal sized croc. And here is Maximus. Estimated to be between 6 and 7 metres in length. As you can imagine, he is very good at intimidating his rivals. He is rarely seen on the bank, probably because of his massive size. This area of the Ord River is adjacent to many cattle properties. Seen here is a helicopter doing a survey, possibly checking how many of their cattle are still alive. Often crocodiles are seen grouped together. Here you can see four crocodiles hanging around in the one spot. Recently a local cattle station reported that they lose one to two cows per day to crocodile attacks. And with the sheer numbers of crocodiles I have seen in this area, I have no doubt. This has been Jeremy Rook, crocstalker.com. Thanks for watching. Please subscribe to my channel.

I've only heard a couple gobbles, but we had a really windy night, so I don't know how vocal the birds are going to be. The game camera is showing birds are coming in here a little later in the morning, 1030-11 o'clock, so this may be a little longer hunting than we're used to, but we're going to give it a shot, and if we can keep the mosquitoes off of us, that'll be a pretty good morning. We're going to go ahead and get blacked out and see what happens. I've got 100 pictures of him too. I've got 3400 pictures of him in one day, so it's pretty good. Oh, there he goes.

Well, we got a little surprised on him. We knew we'd heard a bird over there probably, I don't know, 20 or 30 minutes ago, but he went quiet on us, and just out of the corner of my eye, I caught a bird strutting near the edge of the timber, and we didn't even call at him. He was bouncing in the timber already, strutting out in front of us. I couldn't shoot him for a long time because he was so close to it, but I'm pretty sure we got a decent shot off. It didn't screw up the decoy too bad, but it put him down, so let's go out here and see what he looks like. Well, opening morning's paid off pretty good for us. I'd done some pretty good scouting here, and the pictures were showing the birds were here, but man, when we set up this morning, we wasn't very confident in it. We had some birds quite a ways behind us, and then over here across the creek, we knew there were some birds. Well, we even talked about getting up and moving, but we went ahead and stuck it out for another 20, 30 minutes, and one of the birds we'd heard over across the creek, evidently he had moved in on us, and we didn't see him until he was about 30 yards away. He strutted out here, put on a good show for us, and we put the tag on one opening morning.\nComment: loved the vid make more"},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Top 3 Most Memorable Wild Animal Experiences Spawned from a viewer comment, I discuss 2 (actually 3) of my most memorable animal experiences while in the backcountry. And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around.

There were a few notices put up by the hotel indicating that wild animals are not to be fed. Since this squirrel looked rather tame and more familiar with the surroundings I thought of giving it a banana :) May be it was used to the hotel guests feeding it. I was very close and was able to admire it while it was feeding itself. The surrounding of the resort hotel chalet where we stayed was rather interior and was bordering a Wildlife Sanctuary. Grizzled Giant Squirrel - (Ratufa Macroura) ================================= The grizzled giant squirrel is a large tree squirrel found in the highlands of Sri Lanka and India. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as near threatened due to habitat loss and hunting. Countries - Native - India , Sri Lanka Taxonomic Notes - There are three very distinct subspecies, with one present in India and all three present in Sri Lanka. Red List Category & Criteria - Near Threatened Justification - Listed as Near Threatened because this species is probably in significant decline due to habitat loss and hunting throughout much of its range. Range Description - This species is endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. In India it is known from only five severely fragmented locations, while it occurs more widely and less fragmented in Sri Lanka. Population - The Indian population has been estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals, and the population has been decling due to habitat loss and hunting The population of this species is considerably higher in Sri Lanka. Habitat and Ecology - It is a diurnal and arboreal species. It occurs in tropical dry deciduous and montane forests, where it is confined to the riverine habitats. It has a generation time of ~7-8 years. Major Threats- Habitat loss and degradation due to agro-industry farming, small-scale logging, selective logging, increase in human settlements, forest fire, inter-specific competition, competition from alien species, hunting for local consumption purposes, presence of domestic predators have been observed to be the major threats for this species. The grizzled giant squirrel's common name came from the grey to brown colouration highlighted with white at the top of the tail, giving it a grizzled appearance. The rest of the body varies in colour geographically and may be brown, red, grey or black, but the fur on the underside is always lighter than the back. This agile climber is adapted for life spent almost entirely in the trees, and has a very long tail for balance, broad hands for climbing and large claws for gripping branches. The ears are short, round and sometimes tufted.Music By Lohstana David from Jamendo .com\nTranscript: \nComment: ..how amazing! your videos about animals are always fascinating me! best wishes for the week!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

And he's a resident at the Wildcat Haven Sanctuary. Watch him just sip, sip, sip some water. He and others like him are rescued from assholes that think that they can maintain an exotic animal in their house. Look at this beautiful serval. Servals are amazing, but they're from Africa and the Sahara. So what's it doing here in beautiful Sherwood, Oregon? I'll tell you, as I was saying, many assholes out there think it's okay to raise an exotic animal. And they have no prior experience, and it's just horrible. So, they wind up here, thankfully, where they're well taken care of. And the Tuller family is doing an amazing job. This sanctuary is now open to the public, and they're provided with everything they need. Look, they're all just chilling! Bobcats, FYI, eat all sorts of nasty shit, I'm telling you, from rabbits to chickens. Oh, look at this! It's the Wildcat Haven Cougar Alley! Now, cougars are awesome, beautiful, big wildcats. Oh, hello there! Meow. This gorgeous baby is like, wait a second, do I know you? Now, the Wildcat Haven Sanctuary is home to bobcats, cougars, hybrids, lynx, servals, and tigers. It is an amazing organization, a non-profit, a no-kill sanctuary. Oh my goodness, and look how precious this cougar is! Hi sweetie, how are you doing? I'm fine, just chilling. You have any antelope on ya? This one just wants some tender vittles. Sniffing around, sniffing around. Meow. More like, roar! Oh, how gorgeous.

Tiger just wants some rubs. Look how affectionate this baby is. Oh my goodness. And this is Nora, the Bengal tiger. Now, Bengal tigers get this way due to a lack of red and yellow pigments. Hello! And also, inbreeding promotes recessive traits, and having the lack of the orange is a recessive trait. And sadly, a lot of inbreeding is done just to, you know, continue this species. But they're gorgeous. All of these rescued wildcats are getting a new lease on life, thanks to the Wildcat Haven Sanctuary.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: o my god they are still doing thous bad thing to thous cat man is just bad hunters shound be jailed for killing the big cat wants with man the way i see i we are just to big so get out off the land of big cats is there home is been there home for millines of yers long be for men heres want i think tar down the cat farms and sent he big cats free and lock up the hunters for life stop selling poison to man so no on will be killed no more man in big cat lands is best."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: He is my hero i love to whatch him and hear is voice love insects and  love who he explains everything!

Even a small wild cat can inflict serious injury.In this episode we look at a lesser cat called the Caracal. Their name is taken from a Turkish word that means \"black ear.\" The Caracal is known best for its large black ears that it uses for its great hunting ability.The Caracal roams the grasslands and open plains from Africa through the Middle East. While its numbers are holding in Africa, we see populations becoming extinct in India due to farming and the unrestricted manufacturing of charcoal from the wild weeds, especially in the Banni grasslands. By supporting animal conservation in these areas we can help save the land for the Caracals and other wildlife. Captive Caracals in the US suffer from people trying to keep them as pets, as well as trying to crossbreed them with domestic cats for the pet trade.For more info about BIG CAT RESCUE visit:  us on FACEBOOK:     YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, so today's species spotlight is on the caracal, which most people say, what is a caracal? Well, we're going to show you one and talk a little bit about them. That is Crackle, and she is a caracal. Caracals are sometimes called desert lynx, but in all reality, they are more closely related to your domestic cat at home than to any of the lynx, being either Siberian lynx or Canadian lynx. One of the characteristics that make them very unique is the fact that they have a pretty plain solid coat. There are only a few other cats that have that sort of coat without markings, and that would be cougars and lions, and strangely enough, they are about the same color as the caracals. The caracals have jet black ears, the back of their ears are black, and they have long tufts, just like the lynx, so that's probably why a lot of people associated them with the lynx or thought they were related. So caracals are found throughout Africa, and they're actually found through the Middle East and parts of Asia, and strangely enough, geographically, caracals are found in the same areas that you find cheetahs. Cheetahs and caracals were found in actually the same locations, and one of the things about these two species is they were both trained by humans to hunt animals on behalf of the humans. So the caracals were trained to hunt birds, rabbits, small gazelles, and of course the cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey. Very fascinating that both of these animals were not tamed, but conditioned by humans to hunt animals, and there was actually contests at one time between the caracals to see which one could kill the most birds, the most pigeons in a flock, and the cheetahs, which one could go fastest and bring down the biggest prey. For the most part, the smaller cats, the smaller predators, they eat animals relative to their size, so they would eat smaller birds or mice, but the caracals actually go after much larger prey. So one of the coolest things about the caracals is that they have this uncanny leaping ability, and they can actually catch birds on the wing. They've been recorded in the wild as jumping up to three meters high, which is almost about as high as I am right now. One of the other facts about caracals is they often live in the plains, and a lot of times they're found where the forest meets the plains. This does put them vulnerable to lions, hyenas, leopards, some of the bigger predators, and oftentimes they do fall prey to these larger animals. So they're not always the hunter, a lot of times they become the hunted. So one of the strange things about the caracal is in a lot of their range, especially in Asia and the Middle East, they're considered endangered, because they're very rare. And then on the other hand, in Africa, a lot of times caracals are considered nuisance, and they're just simply killed because they're a threat to livestock. Here at Big Cat Rescue, all of our caracals were former pets. Along with the serval, the caracal is just very popular among cat collectors, and probably one of the biggest misconceptions with the caracals is the fact that they are so cute when they are babies. They are the most adorable little kittens you've ever seen. Most people don't realize they're going to grow up to be this hissy animal that's going to spray on everything and try to bite you all the time. And there's been several attempts to hybridize these animals, some successful, some not successful, with domestic cats to give everyone sort of an exotic cat that's not quite wild. To me, that's a pretty shady thing to do. These are truly wild animals, great hunters out in the wild. They shouldn't be put in cages. They absolutely shouldn't be diluted down with domestic cat DNA. That's not what they were made to be. And here at Big Cat Rescue, of course, our philosophy is these animals belong in the wild, and the only way that we can ever accomplish that is if we preserve enough habitat in the \nComment: @MinsterRogers It's the only thought we should have, these cats will never be domesticated but they will always be dangerous, the only place they should be is in the wild. Our species needs to adapt and evolve instead of trying to control everything we can, what we need to to is educate, and preserve their natural habitat and they will survive :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

They suspect that poachers killed their mother for her pelt. At first, everyone thinks they're leopard cubs. It turns out they're the rarest of finds. Two clouded leopard cubs. The find captures the imagination of top Indian wildlife photographer Sandesh Kadur. Cats have always fascinated me, and when I heard about these clouded leopards being rehabilitated back into the wild, I dropped everything and rushed to the spot to document the whole process. In terms of filming a new species of cat, I mean, this was it. This is the holy grail. Clouded leopards are amazing creatures, the smallest of the big cats. Shy and elusive, even cat specialists know little about their habits in the wild. Just keeping them alive is a big challenge. A leading vet, Dr. Bhaskar Chowdhury, takes charge of caring for these very special cubs. That was the first experience for me to see wild clouded leopard cubs for the first time in my life. So I was really excited and also a bit nervous because the onus is on us, the veterinarians, to make them survive. Bhaskar is determined that the cubs don't end up in the zoo like most orphaned big cats. He gets permission to try something totally unprecedented, to teach clouded leopard cubs how to be wild. It's totally new, never been tried, never been tested, and people, you know, many scientists won't believe this. It's a huge gamble. If his new protocol succeeds, it will boost dwindling numbers of clouded leopards in their real home, the forest. If they get it wrong, the cubs will die.\nComment: what a dumb comment - \"whether at an old age\", well, if they make it to 'old age' they will then, by definition, no longer be 'cubs', will they?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

For more information go to \nTranscript: This is a barn owl. Wow, it's such a beautiful bird. Look at some of its amazing adaptations. It's got this incredible heart-shaped face. Now the facial disc actually gathers sound in the same way as your ears do. The ears are actually just behind the eyes within the feathers, which are really hard to see. And when it's hunting, it can actually hear the sounds of small mammals on the ground below, which is incredible. Its flight is very, very quiet, partly because the feathers are so soft and the body is so light, it passes through the air really, really gently. The legs are really, really long, which is an adaptation for diving into long grass and catching the small mammals which they feed on. The eyesight is amazing as well. Barn owls are able to detect movement when there's hardly any light. It's just such an incredible bird. But unfortunately, there are some problems with the barn owl because of these specialisations. Adapted for hunting from the air, it has to be very light. Barn owls can't put on a lot of fat to help them get through the winter. And also, its feathers, which are so soft and not particularly waterproof, so a barn owl can't hunt during the rain. And so the weather has an effect, food shortage has an effect, and numbers of barn owls go up and down tremendously in response to these environmental changes. It's a sad fact that barn owls have declined tremendously, particularly since World War II. The landscape upon which we all depend has changed tremendously. And barn owls have declined because of a reduction in food supply, because of intensive agriculture, loss of hedgerows, loss of old pasture, loss of the rough grassland with all those small mammals in it. Unfortunately, they're prone to accidental deaths. They die from flying into things like motor vehicles on motorways. And a lot of barn owls starve to death because of a lack of food. So the numbers have gone down by at least 70% since the 1930s, which is something we're really trying to address. Because of their rarity, barn owls are afforded special legal protection. They're not only protected against being killed, as are most wild birds, but they're also protected against disturbance whilst they're nesting. Barn owls are also known as an indicator species. If there are barn owls, plenty of them, in the environment, then that's an indication that actually the food chain is really healthy. There's lots of nice, rough habitat supporting lots of small mammals, supporting barn owls. And if you have that habitat, of course, there's so much other biodiversity which will be supported by it.

Even a small wild cat can inflict serious injury.In this episode we look at a lesser cat called the Caracal. Their name is taken from a Turkish word that means \"black ear.\" The Caracal is known best for its large black ears that it uses for its great hunting ability.The Caracal roams the grasslands and open plains from Africa through the Middle East. While its numbers are holding in Africa, we see populations becoming extinct in India due to farming and the unrestricted manufacturing of charcoal from the wild weeds, especially in the Banni grasslands. By supporting animal conservation in these areas we can help save the land for the Caracals and other wildlife. Captive Caracals in the US suffer from people trying to keep them as pets, as well as trying to crossbreed them with domestic cats for the pet trade.For more info about BIG CAT RESCUE visit:  us on FACEBOOK:     YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, so today's species spotlight is on the caracal, which most people say, what is a caracal? Well, we're going to show you one and talk a little bit about them. That is Crackle, and she is a caracal. Caracals are sometimes called desert lynx, but in all reality, they are more closely related to your domestic cat at home than to any of the lynx, being either Siberian lynx or Canadian lynx. One of the characteristics that make them very unique is the fact that they have a pretty plain solid coat. There are only a few other cats that have that sort of coat without markings, and that would be cougars and lions, and strangely enough, they are about the same color as the caracals. The caracals have jet black ears, the back of their ears are black, and they have long tufts, just like the lynx, so that's probably why a lot of people associated them with the lynx or thought they were related. So caracals are found throughout Africa, and they're actually found through the Middle East and parts of Asia, and strangely enough, geographically, caracals are found in the same areas that you find cheetahs. Cheetahs and caracals were found in actually the same locations, and one of the things about these two species is they were both trained by humans to hunt animals on behalf of the humans. So the caracals were trained to hunt birds, rabbits, small gazelles, and of course the cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey. Very fascinating that both of these animals were not tamed, but conditioned by humans to hunt animals, and there was actually contests at one time between the caracals to see which one could kill the most birds, the most pigeons in a flock, and the cheetahs, which one could go fastest and bring down the biggest prey. For the most part, the smaller cats, the smaller predators, they eat animals relative to their size, so they would eat smaller birds or mice, but the caracals actually go after much larger prey. So one of the coolest things about the caracals is that they have this uncanny leaping ability, and they can actually catch birds on the wing. They've been recorded in the wild as jumping up to three meters high, which is almost about as high as I am right now. One of the other facts about caracals is they often live in the plains, and a lot of times they're found where the forest meets the plains. This does put them vulnerable to lions, hyenas, leopards, some of the bigger predators, and oftentimes they do fall prey to these larger animals. So they're not always the hunter, a lot of times they become the hunted. So one of the strange things about the caracal is in a lot of their range, especially in Asia and the Middle East, they're considered endangered, because they're very rare. And then on the other hand, in Africa, a lot of times caracals are considered nuisance, and they're just simply killed because they're a threat to livestock. Here at Big Cat Rescue, all of our caracals were former pets. Along with the serval, the caracal is just very popular among cat collectors, and probably one of the biggest misconceptions with the caracals is the fact that they are so cute when they are babies. They are the most adorable little kittens you've ever seen. Most people don't realize they're going to grow up to be this hissy animal that's going to spray on everything and try to bite you all the time. And there's been several attempts to hybridize these animals, some successful, some not successful, with domestic cats to give everyone sort of an exotic cat that's not quite wild. To me, that's a pretty shady thing to do. These are truly wild animals, great hunters out in the wild. They shouldn't be put in cages. They absolutely shouldn't be diluted down with domestic cat DNA. That's not what they were made to be. And here at Big Cat Rescue, of course, our philosophy is these animals belong in the wild, and the only way that we can ever accomplish that is if we preserve enough habitat in the \nComment: It is not a pointless question. If you go to our website and look for caracals under the \"Big Cat Photos and Facts\" menu item you can hear the sounds big cats make."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: And this is the work of the master builder among bower birds. I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: Just imagine how complex that birds brain must be. The amount of work that would need to be done to recreate it with AI and information technology is massive."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over.

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: yeah tell me about it shells are getting to expensive to"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Big Cat Rescue recently installed a solar power system thanks to the generous support of The Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, TECO-Tampa Electrical and Solar Energy Management. We're so happy that the sanctuary was given the opportunity to help save the planet by utilizing green energy sources and we hope to expand in the future!Check in on our solar power system here:  Energy Management:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Big Cat Rescue is going greeeeen! What? What does this mean? Oh. Big Cat Rescue decided to do our part to help save the planet by installing a solar power system. The installation was made possible by grants from the Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, and a solar electric rebate from TECO. The overall cost of the installation was $18,250. It took the team from Solar Energy Management around three days to install the system. They have to make sure that the solar panels are at the optimal angle so they can capture as much energy as possible from the sun. Throughout the installation, the team were constantly supervised by the cats. In particular, Joseph and Sasha. And, of course, TJ the tiger who was very interested in what was happening around him. For the projected 25-year life of the system, annual utility savings are expected to average around $1,542. So this will total to over $38,000 in savings. And just as importantly, carbon dioxide emissions that will be saved over the life of the system is projected at 157 tons, which is equivalent to driving 314,000 automotive miles. The sanctuary will be using the energy to power all of our pool pumps. So our tigers will have a place to cool off. Max the bobcat can take the occasional dip. And we can constantly replace the water that TJ splashes out of his pool. Plus, any excess power goes backwards through the electrical meter and is supplied to the main office building. Solar Energy Management generously donated two extra panels to the sanctuary. So instead of 20 panels, we have 22. And all 22 individual modules have their own microinverter underneath the panel. What's a microinverter, you might ask? And that's the box right here. And that's the box right here. So the advantages to the microinverter technology are if partial shading occurs or bird droppings fall on a panel and it degrades the performance of this panel, it doesn't affect any of the rest of the panels, so you can maximize power production. And the data collected by all 22 microinverters is transferred to the communication gateway, which then verifies that they're functioning and transmits the data, which is collected every five minutes, wirelessly to the main office where we can check on their status. You can actually monitor the output and production from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. On the webpage, you can check that all the panels are functioning correctly, see how much energy they've produced over different periods of time, and see the environmental benefits to date, such as how the energy could be used. And you can even see how many trees we've saved with our carbon offset. We're so pleased that we've been able to take our first step towards using green energy, thanks to the generous support of several organizations. Our solar panel system is also very easy to add on to, so we hope to do this in the future and continue to do our part for the environment. And I'm sure TJ will enjoy the entertainment. Microsoft Mechanics www.microsoft.com www.microsoft.com\nComment: I'm very impressed with this project, BCR!!  This really shows that you guys look at the whole picture.  You are not only helping these cats directly by providing them excellent homes, you are reducing your impact on the environment to help preserve the habitat for wild cats.  This is fantastic.  Great job! :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: Buffalo! Buffalo! Buffalo! I live in Buffalo, and I have never seen a buffalo besides the fake ones that are put along the thruway. Hahaha It must have been so cool to see them up close! Maybe about 5 years back the city had a thing where they made Buffalo statues (like the one you are standing next to) and painted them all different ways. Then they sold them to benefit a charity. Now you can see them scattered around town in different areas. Great video chris!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

We've had these chickadees in this nest for quite a few weeks now and with all the cats around here, they rarely ever make it. Yeah, they're flying all around. Boy, there might be four babies. There's baby number four just getting ready. There's the fourth one. It came out and landed on the ground. I'm going to stay here so the cat doesn't get it. That's one chickadee that just about got ate. Apologize for the sound of the lawnmower, but it's pretty neat. Four baby chickadees. This is like the true survival story right here. All these birds never make it because there's just too many cats around here. This is kind of a messed up situation. I'm about four foot away from this bird and I want to leave them alone so that they can go about their natural way, but as soon as I leave, that cat is going to come and eat this bird. It'll get ate if it doesn't get its flying wings. There's their nest in the lower right hand of the screen. I left that one alone. We shooed away the cats, so hopefully the mama can get this little one that was sitting on that metal ring to fly up in the tree with the others, but you can hear them everywhere. And me, I'm running around trying to videotape the baby birds and keep the cats from eating them, which is a bit ironic because I'm a hunter. It's so bad that I hunt, yet I'm trying to save the baby birds from being hunted. Anyway, thanks for watching and thanks for all the comments and support. Talk to you guys later.

She told her to go and to be free and to eat. And that's exactly what she's done, and she's been just a wonderful animal. She's really enjoyed Crackle. Here of late, though, she's been sick. We found her in her den, just being cold and unresponsive, so we brought her into the camp hospital. And our big cat rescuers have been hand-feeding her and giving her lots of attention. She's perked up beautifully, and it's raining outside. So until we have better weather, we'll keep her inside here. We're going to keep her warm and dry.

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: The differences are only in the animals themselves, their strategies and their settings. In the sky, there's no place for a stalking predator to hide. So for the element of surprise, the peregrine falcon has to resort to sheer speed. In a dive, it's the fastest bird in the world. So fast, it's breathtaking. It stalks by flying high and relying on eyes that are as good as telescopes. The fat, slow-looking pigeon might seem to be doomed, but it evolved as peregrines evolved and is equipped to watch for them. Eyes on the side of its head Eyes on the side of its head enable the pigeon to forage for seed and scan the sky at the same time. It spies the peregrine. And once it's in the air, it becomes a racer. The peregrine, lightness, streamlining, speed. The pigeon, strength, endurance, enough speed. And a head start. The peregrine is more manoeuvrable. The pigeon has a wider field of vision and plenty of manoeuvres of its own. It's also flying for its life. This time, the pigeon outflies its pursuer. This peregrine is still young and just learning that she can fly. But speed by itself isn't always enough. It must race its game.\nComment: Peregrine falcons are amazing!

I'm the director of Genesis Wildlife Conservation Center and the Sanctuary. We began in about 1983, and then it grew from there so that we're now a charity. We collect from the people who come here, donors. Some of it we get from foundations. But we rehab about 600 to 700 birds and animals every year. Most of them are released back to the wild, and some of them can be released to their own environment. Music Because he's so small, he wouldn't really stand a chance out in the wild. Are you guys looking for someone to take him in? No, we keep him and use him for education. You have to have permits to have any of the animals. We have to have federal, state, USDA permits, everything. Music I know. That's why we keep them well padded. All the cages are padded, so when they fall, they only fall to the bedding. That's Samsara. Sam I've had since 1998. Music Such beautiful birds. Sasha is now six months old. She came to us as a baby about five weeks old when the whole nest fell to the ground. Her brother did just fine, and he's already been released. But the female, Sasha, on the x-ray, it shows the right wing just really shattered and not able to pin it. So that's why she stays with us. And we take her around to schools, and we talk about their habitat and the need to preserve it. Music This black and white one down here, though, that has an interesting story because see how her wing droops? That's only part of her injuries. I had released her along with a bunch of other pigeons. And then when she came back, she was in the backyard, like in the middle of February, and it was snow everywhere. And I looked out the back window, and it was just blood everywhere. And I ran out to see what it was, and it was this poor little pigeon. And she had come back to get cared, I guess, or at least it was a safe haven for her. So we treated her. She's blind in one eye. She had a lot of, I mean, her whole side was ripped off. The wing was broken. So I treated her back. She fell in love with the old fantail pigeon. And when the old fantail got sick, she would take care of him. I had him inside in a small cage. She would get up under his wing and walk him to the dinner dish. And her story is that when she was about three weeks old, some kids found her in the bushes, probably while her mom was moving them from one place to another. So she spent the next nine weeks at the animal control, where she was placed in a cage next to dogs and cats. And then she was taken to the vet. So she didn't learn to fear any of us. So that's why she's got to stay with us. I tried to release her a couple times, and it was a failure each time. This one over here is Cali, Calahari. And Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. So she's about seven years old, and she's had a pretty bad life before. I got her from animal control in Ashe, and she had been there 11 months, and they were not able to place her with anybody that had a USDA permit. And you have to have a USDA permit to keep these cats. Hey, come on in. She was just spayed. Again, we use these in educational programs to show people that they really are very sweet animals. They're extremely intelligent, very curious animals. ♪♪ People think the only thing they're good for is just for shooting. They're just supposed to be a sport animal, and they're not. Of course, they serve a lot of different purposes, but other than that, they have their own right to live just because they are. God made all of us, and we all have a right to live. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ You can go to our website, which is genesiswildlife.org, and you can get an idea about our volunteer relationships. We have a lot of volunteers here. We have a lot of groups that come. Sometimes we can get 15 or 20 people. And, of course, you put in three hours. That's an incredible amount of work that we can get done in just one day. So it's really nice when we get Cub Scouts or ASU volunteers. As a matter of fact, we had the ETSU come, and they were the ones that built this whole deck behind me. They built the entire thing in one day, but we had about 20 big guys come here to do that. As far as donations, it's just not monetarily, but you can also donate lumber. You can donate time. You can donate equipment. We get a lot of people who just come with their building their homes, and they have a lot of leftover lumber, a lot of things like that. They can come, and we can use all of that lumber. We can use everything. We get people who just bring in linens, which is extremely important to us. Some people will bring in some of the dog food and the sunflower seeds, bags of bird seed.

The hyenas moo to show affection like a cat purrs.  Then they laugh when getting ready to eat.   They are one of the most intelligent and powerful animas in the world.  Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

They suspect that poachers killed their mother for her pelt. At first, everyone thinks they're leopard cubs. It turns out they're the rarest of finds. Two clouded leopard cubs. The find captures the imagination of top Indian wildlife photographer Sandesh Kadur. Cats have always fascinated me, and when I heard about these clouded leopards being rehabilitated back into the wild, I dropped everything and rushed to the spot to document the whole process. In terms of filming a new species of cat, I mean, this was it. This is the holy grail. Clouded leopards are amazing creatures, the smallest of the big cats. Shy and elusive, even cat specialists know little about their habits in the wild. Just keeping them alive is a big challenge. A leading vet, Dr. Bhaskar Chowdhury, takes charge of caring for these very special cubs. That was the first experience for me to see wild clouded leopard cubs for the first time in my life. So I was really excited and also a bit nervous because the onus is on us, the veterinarians, to make them survive. Bhaskar is determined that the cubs don't end up in the zoo like most orphaned big cats. He gets permission to try something totally unprecedented, to teach clouded leopard cubs how to be wild. It's totally new, never been tried, never been tested, and people, you know, many scientists won't believe this. It's a huge gamble. If his new protocol succeeds, it will boost dwindling numbers of clouded leopards in their real home, the forest. If they get it wrong, the cubs will die.\nComment: Aw.. I really liked this.

She was found chained to a wall in a drug house during a law enforcement raid in Tennessee. Because she'd been confined to live on a concrete floor, she had huge swollen masses on her elbows that took months to heal, and was severely underweight. As you can see, she's made a full recovery since being rescued and is now the largest lion we have at the sanctuary, even bigger than our male lions Joseph and Cameron. Because she's such a big girl who just loves to frolic, run around and play, we wanted to provide Nikita with a large addition to her enclosure that she'd be able to explore and enjoy. Big Cat Rescue is situated on 55 acres in Tampa, Florida, and we're home to over 100 rescued exotic cats that were previously unwanted, abandoned or abused. The sanctuary seeks to provide the very best home we can for the cats in our care, and educate the public about the plight of these magnificent animals. The cats' enclosures are created to provide as natural an environment as possible, including trees for our leopards, who love to climb, pools for the tigers, so they can cool off, and even fresh sand for our sand cats to enjoy. So with Nikita in mind, and our goal set in place, we put our Big Cat plan into action. We wanted Nikita's new habitat to include an additional 3,500 square feet. So we needed to build an enclosure addition that measured 50 feet by 70 feet in size, at a cost of approximately $20,000. We put the word out to our supporters, and they definitely roared into action. Big Cat Rescue is fortunate to have supporters around the world who not only enable us to provide for the well-being of the cats, but also that of the sanctuary's fiscal sustainability. Lawrence and Pamela Tristle are two long-time supporters who generously donated half the cost to build Nikita's enclosure expansion as a matching grant, and hundreds of other supporters responded to help meet our goal. The first thing we had to do was make room for the addition, which meant lots of trimming, weeding, root removal, and leveling of the ground. Thanks to volunteers from the U.S. Army Citrus Park Recruiting Station here in Tampa, and of course, Big Cat Rescue volunteers, this was accomplished in record time, while Nikita kept busy watching over all involved. The perimeter of Nikita's new addition was marked out, and construction began. The walls of the enclosure were to be 15 feet in height, with a 5-foot cantilever, making the total height of the enclosure approximately 18 feet. Once all of the posts were in place, over 50 panels were hung, reinforced, cut to size, and then fixed in place. This process took almost three weeks to complete, and I'm sure Nikita was feeling a little sympathetic towards the workers. Then, the big day arrived. The Big Cat transformation was complete. Donors, volunteers, interns, and staff members alike all turned out to see Nikita take her first steps in her new territory. Everything was in place, including Nikita's favorite big yellow boomer ball, as well as a paper mache warthog for her to make friends with. Nikita was definitely ready to explore, while everybody eagerly looked on, and she didn't disappoint. Take a look. Big Cat Rescue would like to thank everyone who made this possible. Nikita may show her appreciation in unique ways, but thanks to our supporters, donors, and volunteers, we've truly enriched the life of this big girl.\nComment: Thank you.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: This world will be a sorry place if all the large carnivores become extinct. :("},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: This was emotional & EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE!!!

Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Happy Birthday Flavio!\nObviously, you guys take very good care of your cats, but it looks (and sounds) like the circus the cats performed at took care of them as well?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Are you guys looking for someone to take him in? No, we keep him and use him for education. You have to have permits to have any of the animals. We have to have federal, state, USDA permits, everything. Music I know. That's why we keep them well padded. All the cages are padded, so when they fall, they only fall to the bedding. That's Samsara. Sam I've had since 1998. Music Such beautiful birds. Sasha is now six months old. She came to us as a baby about five weeks old when the whole nest fell to the ground. Her brother did just fine, and he's already been released. But the female, Sasha, on the x-ray, it shows the right wing just really shattered and not able to pin it. So that's why she stays with us. And we take her around to schools, and we talk about their habitat and the need to preserve it. Music This black and white one down here, though, that has an interesting story because see how her wing droops? That's only part of her injuries. I had released her along with a bunch of other pigeons. And then when she came back, she was in the backyard, like in the middle of February, and it was snow everywhere. And I looked out the back window, and it was just blood everywhere. And I ran out to see what it was, and it was this poor little pigeon. And she had come back to get cared, I guess, or at least it was a safe haven for her. So we treated her. She's blind in one eye. She had a lot of, I mean, her whole side was ripped off. The wing was broken. So I treated her back. She fell in love with the old fantail pigeon. And when the old fantail got sick, she would take care of him. I had him inside in a small cage. She would get up under his wing and walk him to the dinner dish. And her story is that when she was about three weeks old, some kids found her in the bushes, probably while her mom was moving them from one place to another. So she spent the next nine weeks at the animal control, where she was placed in a cage next to dogs and cats. And then she was taken to the vet. So she didn't learn to fear any of us. So that's why she's got to stay with us. I tried to release her a couple times, and it was a failure each time. This one over here is Cali, Calahari. And Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. So she's about seven years old, and she's had a pretty bad life before. I got her from animal control in Ashe, and she had been there 11 months, and they were not able to place her with anybody that had a USDA permit. And you have to have a USDA permit to keep these cats. Hey, come on in. She was just spayed. Again, we use these in educational programs to show people that they really are very sweet animals. They're extremely intelligent, very curious animals. ♪♪ People think the only thing they're good for is just for shooting. They're just supposed to be a sport animal, and they're not. Of course, they serve a lot of different purposes, but other than that, they have their own right to live just because they are. God made all of us, and we all have a right to live. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ You can go to our website, which is genesiswildlife.org, and you can get an idea about our volunteer relationships. We have a lot of volunteers here. We have a lot of groups that come. Sometimes we can get 15 or 20 people. And, of course, you put in three hours. That's an incredible amount of work that we can get done in just one day. So it's really nice when we get Cub Scouts or ASU volunteers. As a matter of fact, we had the ETSU come, and they were the ones that built this whole deck behind me. They built the entire thing in one day, but we had about 20 big guys come here to do that. As far as donations, it's just not monetarily, but you can also donate lumber. You can donate time. You can donate equipment. We get a lot of people who just come with their building their homes, and they have a lot of leftover lumber, a lot of things like that. They can come, and we can use all of that lumber. We can use everything. We get people who just bring in linens, which is extremely important to us. Some people will bring in some of the dog food and the sunflower seeds, bags of bird seed.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: iFly TV: Inspiring People Katherine Conner of BLES iFly KLM Magazine travels to Thailand to interview Katherine Conner who devotes her life to the wellbeing of elephants.\nTranscript: When people travel to Thailand, the thing that they want to do is to see an elephant, to ride an elephant, to feed an elephant. What a lot of people don't realize is the abuse that builds up to allowing that elephant to allow you to mount its back and to ride it. Many female elephants, when they give birth, they will actually kill their calves. And I feel that that is because they know what kind of life that baby is going to have and they don't want the baby to go through it. So they would rather just kill it as soon as it's born. It's a chain of cruelty that we have to stop right now. And the people who can stop it are the tourists coming to Thailand. They are the ones with the power. I am Catherine Connor, the founder of Bunlok Elephant Sanctuary Bless in Sukhothai, Thailand. Here, our number one priority is the elephant's welfare. We're not interested in profit. We're not interested in keeping the tourists happy. We just want to make a difference to the lives of these abused elephants. The rhythm here is beautiful. It's slow. We work on elephant time. You know, when the elephants want to go, we follow. If they want to stop and graze, we wait. And I think that for a lot of people who come here, it's a whole different world. It's a whole different way of looking and dealing with life. And I think that we change people when they come here. Here we have Phang Noi and Phang Soi. And behind you, you have Wassana, Lotus and Phang Dao. And they are collectively known as the Gossip Girls because they are non-stop trumpeting, roaring, squeaking, purring. You see, normally the cameras are all on them. People are wondering when it's going to be their turn. I have always had a passion for animals. And when I came to Thailand, I knew I wanted to see elephants. I began to volunteer at an elephant center in North Thailand. And I met a baby elephant called Bunrot, which is Thai for survivor. That baby elephant reached out and touched me. He changed my life forever. If he hadn't have died, I'm not sure I would have created BLAST because I would have just all my attention and all my focus and all my funds would have been going on to him. Elephants in Thailand, they were always held in very high regard. They were used for logging. And in 1989, Thailand banned that. And so what happened was thousands of elephants and their owners were unemployed. So what do they do? They're not going to give up their elephant. They need to provide for their family. That is when elephant tourism was born. Elephants are forced to perform tricks and the training that goes on to achieve that is diabolical. They're put through a breaking process. The baby elephant is stabbed repeatedly and beaten repeatedly until the spirit is broken. What it then becomes is a machine for the tourist trade. This is Bunthong. We found her in a tourist camp in Pattaya, giving trekking rides. So that means she had that big heavy chair on her back. As a result of years of doing that, she has a broken back. This is Wassana. She stood on a landmine when she was illegally logging on one of the Thai borders. Despite the fact that she is missing parts of her front foot, she was still sold into the tourist trade and forced to give rides. I mean at the end of the day, I don't think any of us are cruel. And I think most of the cruelty that goes on with elephants in Thailand is lack of education. I think most of these elephant owners don't know the damage that they're doing to their elephant's spine and joints. If they knew, I would hope that they would stop. At Bless, we have three guest houses that sleep two people each. We charge people to stay here. We have no programme, no schedule. We never encourage our guests to approach the elephant, encroach on their space. Our vision is to rescue the abused elephants, to recuperate them, to teach them how to be elephants again and then to release them onto protected land where they can live as wild elephants again. One of the biggest things for me, the thing that amazes me about them the most, is their ability to forgive. You know, these elephants, all of them have been abused by us, by humans. And yet, here they are, comfortable, accepting us, allowing us into their space, allowing us to walk along beside them. I just find that incredible.\nComment: This is a wonderful place but I think she’s wrong...a LOT of people are determinedly and intentionally cruel."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Our mission for this outing was to focus on animals that tend to converge near watering holes; however, on the drive over the first animal we spotted was the ever elusive leopard. It literally walked right out in front of our Land Rover, and our guide Lloyd was even more excited than us. As the day progressed we witnessed plenty of fascinating events at random watering holes. Impalas, wildebeests and buffalo drinking with crocodiles lurking dangerously submerged under the water. In another section Hippos lazily bathing in mud and a monitor lizard slinking across a barren stretch of land. It was another very eventful safari and we ended up spotting all of 'The Big 5' with mere minutes left on tour with an intimate encounter with a Rhino to close things off.

Monty, he's aged around, what are you, about 4 or 5 years old, so he's still a youngster and he's just incredible, he's almost like a human trapped in a plastic bag.

She was found chained to a wall in a drug house during a law enforcement raid in Tennessee. Because she'd been confined to live on a concrete floor, she had huge swollen masses on her elbows that took months to heal, and was severely underweight. As you can see, she's made a full recovery since being rescued and is now the largest lion we have at the sanctuary, even bigger than our male lions Joseph and Cameron. Because she's such a big girl who just loves to frolic, run around and play, we wanted to provide Nikita with a large addition to her enclosure that she'd be able to explore and enjoy. Big Cat Rescue is situated on 55 acres in Tampa, Florida, and we're home to over 100 rescued exotic cats that were previously unwanted, abandoned or abused. The sanctuary seeks to provide the very best home we can for the cats in our care, and educate the public about the plight of these magnificent animals. The cats' enclosures are created to provide as natural an environment as possible, including trees for our leopards, who love to climb, pools for the tigers, so they can cool off, and even fresh sand for our sand cats to enjoy. So with Nikita in mind, and our goal set in place, we put our Big Cat plan into action. We wanted Nikita's new habitat to include an additional 3,500 square feet. So we needed to build an enclosure addition that measured 50 feet by 70 feet in size, at a cost of approximately $20,000. We put the word out to our supporters, and they definitely roared into action. Big Cat Rescue is fortunate to have supporters around the world who not only enable us to provide for the well-being of the cats, but also that of the sanctuary's fiscal sustainability. Lawrence and Pamela Tristle are two long-time supporters who generously donated half the cost to build Nikita's enclosure expansion as a matching grant, and hundreds of other supporters responded to help meet our goal. The first thing we had to do was make room for the addition, which meant lots of trimming, weeding, root removal, and leveling of the ground. Thanks to volunteers from the U.S. Army Citrus Park Recruiting Station here in Tampa, and of course, Big Cat Rescue volunteers, this was accomplished in record time, while Nikita kept busy watching over all involved. The perimeter of Nikita's new addition was marked out, and construction began. The walls of the enclosure were to be 15 feet in height, with a 5-foot cantilever, making the total height of the enclosure approximately 18 feet. Once all of the posts were in place, over 50 panels were hung, reinforced, cut to size, and then fixed in place. This process took almost three weeks to complete, and I'm sure Nikita was feeling a little sympathetic towards the workers. Then, the big day arrived. The Big Cat transformation was complete. Donors, volunteers, interns, and staff members alike all turned out to see Nikita take her first steps in her new territory. Everything was in place, including Nikita's favorite big yellow boomer ball, as well as a paper mache warthog for her to make friends with. Nikita was definitely ready to explore, while everybody eagerly looked on, and she didn't disappoint. Take a look. Big Cat Rescue would like to thank everyone who made this possible. Nikita may show her appreciation in unique ways, but thanks to our supporters, donors, and volunteers, we've truly enriched the life of this big girl.\nComment: THANK YOU and every little bit helps!

The hyenas moo to show affection like a cat purrs.  Then they laugh when getting ready to eat.   They are one of the most intelligent and powerful animas in the world.  Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: They sure are tasty"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five. I'm Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism.\nComment: im 14 and live in south louisiana. iv been hunting since i was 6 with a .410 and 20 gauge, but this year i decided to do air rifle hunting with my .22 pellet gun. most seasons, i only get 1 or 2 squirrels. this year, i got 3 so far, and i still have untill february to hunt plus im getting a new scope!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore.

The white sticks out, so its chances of being seen by an eagle or a python, a mongoose, a rival predator, are so much greater. The normal coloured cubs, they blend with the forest floor, the leaf litter, the dappled light in the forest, they kind of disappear. The white cub sticks out like a beacon, very very vulnerable, and its colour makes it even more vulnerable. See the white tiger there trying to suckle on the other tiger, instinctive, gets no milk so immediately starts shouting. All three cubs now gone to sleep. Clambering over these rocks has taken it out of them, all their heads going down, little yawns, eyes closing, nice warm rocks, sun dropping now, temperature dropping, and they're all off for a nice little snooze. The number of sounds that I use to communicate with the cubs, I give a little purring sound, this is what a cheetah mother uses with her cubs, see how it calms them down, and then I use the little chuffing sound. See the other cubs are responding to the purr. Today the little cubs, just a month old, have had their first experience of water, and their first swimming experience. Now of all the big cats, tigers love the water the most. They live in areas where there are big monsoon rains, big rivers, and they will swim. In fact, in the Shundabans, they will swim 15 kilometers between the islands hunting for food. Watch how Shine helps Shunda climb out of the water. This is a typical den site that a tigress will use, nice little caves, and in here she can put these little cubs, get them into the crevices, and make it difficult for a rival predator to get inside. Now every few days, she will move those cubs to a new den site. When the scent builds up, the urine, the dung inside the den, it becomes smelly, and she takes the cub and moves it to a den site that she's found somewhere nearby.\nComment: They are all cute and prety , how old are they.:-) :-D "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: I responded to your other comment with some information you might be interested in.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Not that we know of, he still as a really good appetite, usually if the cats begin to lose interest in their food we investigate further, but Flavio is still pretty solid despite his stiff joints."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Campers arrive every day and get to explore our 55 acre property, making sure they say hello to the cats and taking lots of photos along the way. While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this. We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life. Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans. They get to do lots of fun activities, like making Big Cat popsicles and learning about our operant conditioning program and why it's so important to the cats at the sanctuary. Then campers observe Big Cat keepers handing out the popsicles they made and the cats willingly participating in our operant conditioning program.

Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old.

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: @KennethKramm Thanks for stopping by Ken and commenting.

Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: That's a good question, maybe we should try this at some point?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: to save lions in the wild, the countries where they exist would need to recognize the value of lions as a resource, and protect them and their environment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

The sanctuary is a permanent home to over 100 rescued big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards. As well as smaller species like bobcats, servals, and sand cats. Campers arrive every day and get to explore our 55 acre property, making sure they say hello to the cats and taking lots of photos along the way. While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this. We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life. Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans. They get to do lots of fun activities, like making Big Cat popsicles and learning about our operant conditioning program and why it's so important to the cats at the sanctuary. Then campers observe Big Cat keepers handing out the popsicles they made and the cats willingly participating in our operant conditioning program.

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: This channel is like buzzfeed for people with a brain."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: ik it dont happen very much but id still choose a shotgun of a 22 b-cuz i like to have the spread of BB's instead of relying on one little bullet to hit and kill it w/o just wounding it and it getting away"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The white sticks out, so its chances of being seen by an eagle or a python, a mongoose, a rival predator, are so much greater. The normal coloured cubs, they blend with the forest floor, the leaf litter, the dappled light in the forest, they kind of disappear. The white cub sticks out like a beacon, very very vulnerable, and its colour makes it even more vulnerable. See the white tiger there trying to suckle on the other tiger, instinctive, gets no milk so immediately starts shouting. All three cubs now gone to sleep. Clambering over these rocks has taken it out of them, all their heads going down, little yawns, eyes closing, nice warm rocks, sun dropping now, temperature dropping, and they're all off for a nice little snooze. The number of sounds that I use to communicate with the cubs, I give a little purring sound, this is what a cheetah mother uses with her cubs, see how it calms them down, and then I use the little chuffing sound. See the other cubs are responding to the purr. Today the little cubs, just a month old, have had their first experience of water, and their first swimming experience. Now of all the big cats, tigers love the water the most. They live in areas where there are big monsoon rains, big rivers, and they will swim. In fact, in the Shundabans, they will swim 15 kilometers between the islands hunting for food. Watch how Shine helps Shunda climb out of the water. This is a typical den site that a tigress will use, nice little caves, and in here she can put these little cubs, get them into the crevices, and make it difficult for a rival predator to get inside. Now every few days, she will move those cubs to a new den site. When the scent builds up, the urine, the dung inside the den, it becomes smelly, and she takes the cub and moves it to a den site that she's found somewhere nearby.\nComment: look at those babies cute"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The truth to the whole matter is, the Everglades biggest problem lies up north with pollution that should be corrected before spending taxpayers money on a science project that will be a permeant costly disaster if it does not work.We have studied the water flow patterns through the existing culverts for many decades. We have seen how the wildlife has been affected and have analyzed the situation as a whole. The ecosystem and wildlife is disappearing and suffering. Wildlife is becoming smaller in size, becoming weaker, and natural life spans are getting shorter. In 1998 a florida panther was found dead in Everglades Shark River Slough with levels of mercury so high it could kill an adult human.Right now and for the past several months before the 81 to 100 million dollar bridge was even finished water has actually been flowing through the National Park from south to north through the existing culverts; yes, backwards because the water is too polluted. Everyday a test by one of us has been conducted on the bridge to test the direction of the water flow. A hand full of sand is dropped at the opening, but it sinks straight to the bottom. If the flow of water was flowing south the sand would visibly be carried in that direction. Imagine 2.6 miles of water flowing backwards, (yes north) verses the culverts that are in place now. That equals a lot more water traveling north because water pollution regulations do not permit them to flow south through the National Park. Also sending water south would require permission from the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, which owns lands south of Lake Okeechobee and north of Everglades National Park. The Miccosukee Tribe is against the polluted waters being flowed into their land, and they are taking action to preserve their way of life. They would not be able to survive if the water and food is all poisoned. According to Earth Justice the pumps for polluted water on average contribute the equivalent of 60,000 one hundred pound bag of phosphorus to Lake Okeechobee each year.If the bridging is in place unnatural water depths will follow unnatural hydro-periods and water flow patterns. Now all the wildlife's hammocks will be under water, and there will be no dry land. This will result in unhealthy conditions. More water, more water, more water, is not the answer; Clean water, clean water, clean water, is the answer! Because of being in a hurry to build all these bridges that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars are we really going to sacrifice one environment to stop salt water intrusion down south into the bay? Remember there's only one Everglades and its all connected. All these bridges do not save the Everglades, they flood and pollute them more then they already are. We are affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. We have to treat the source of infection instead of covering it up with a bandaid.\nTranscript: Here we are west of the 2.6 mile bridge proposed area at the S333 lock. Water is not flowing into the Tamiami Trail Canal, the lock is closed. Here we are south of that lock. The water is traveling from the west to the east in the canal south of Tamiami Trail. These overflow pipes were located in this area and removed. When water levels would reach the height of the top of the pipe would flow into the pipe. They would act as an overflow and then flow water south into the canal, flowing the water into the National Park. The water now is flowing at a much more rapid rate into the National Park. The problem is it is making a U-turn and finding the path of least resistance due to sawgrass and a southern ridge. It is making a U-turn and flowing north instead of south. The opposite of what it is supposed to do. As the water flows north it travels through these pipes, culverts that flow into the Tamiami Trail Canal. This area is the center of the 2.6 mile proposed bridge. A bridge located here instead of the culverts would flow way more water north, completely drying out the south. You can see the rapid flow rate with three culverts. Imagine a bridge drying out and creating an unnatural drought south of the Tamiami Trail, interrupting the natural process of this part of the Everglades. Wildlife would suffer. Wildlife has already suffered enough due to over 25 years of held water in these areas and too much water and now more water is proposed, over 2 feet more in the canal. As of right now the National Park does not flow water south due to over 10 parts per billion of water pollution regulations. They have not been able to flow water south even through the one mile bridge. Here you can see water rapidly flowing north through these culverts, the area and center of this 2.6 mile bridge. This is not where the bridge should be located. During droughts this area has always flowed water north. Instead of here, the S3334 locks, when opened, create a suction that even increases drastically the water flow north from the south side, drying up the area even faster. Look at the flow going north into the Tamiami Trail Canal. The Everglades does not travel north, should not travel north. Man has interrupted water flows all over the entire Everglades and we are going to do it again with an irreversible situation and billions of taxpayer dollars. This is where the 2.6 mile bridge would be located. The locks at 3333 are closed. The water is traveling south down the L67 Canal making a U-turn and going back north you can see here on the map. The Blue Shanty, the new river, allowing large amounts of water flow north. This is the S3334 lock area. It is also closed. When opened and water flows south, this creates that suction, vacuum, dropping the water sometimes overnight or days, 6 to 8 inches. Unnatural, completely, not allowing the wildlife to adapt. This is not what is supposed to happen with the bridging. The bridging has to be thought about. The 1 mile bridge has not flowed a drop of water south ever since finished. The public has completely been misinformed. Taxpayer dollars are not at work. The 100 million dollar bridge has not worked. We have stopped and checked this area 3 to 4 times a week with a simple test. Water is not flowing in any direction and has not. When the lock is opened at the S333, it will flow south but sawgrass will clog the area restricting lots of flow. And again, taxpayer dollars will not be well spent. And right now, we must at least test the 1 mile bridge before creating more bad decisions. Another 2.6 mile bridge and maybe even more bridging. Bridge is not working right now. It has not for many, many months. The only way to make this water flow south is to create an unnatural level in the canal which will flow and flood the area, being detrimental and terrible for wildlife, especially mammal life. Heavy pollution coming from the north will kill aquatic life, affecting the food chain. This is not the Everglades restoration. This is the Everglades destruction.\nComment: I had John from the Sierra Club write me an email. Below you can read his email, and my response to him. Seems like when ever someone enquires about this video they get the same generic response with NO REAL ANSWERS to the problem. \n\nBelow is the conversation.................................................................................................................................\n\nDear Mr. Harkness,\n\nThank you for contacting the Sierra Club. We took a look at your video and consulted with scientists at Everglades National Park. Your video actually demonstrates the need to restore flow across the central Everglades and elevate Tamiami Trail.\n\nAs you have documented, there is some localized northward flow just to the east of S333, because the water level on the west of the L67 extension levee is higher than water level on the east. Water levels are substantially lower in Northeast Shark Slough than western shark slough because of water management. This all part of the reason why we need to restore more natural flow by elevating the road. The net water flow through the culverts documented by the US Geological Survey since 1939 is north to south, and water will flow north to south as we redirect more water into Northeast Shark Slough under the 2.6 mile bridge.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJonathan Ullman\nSenior Everglades Representative\nSierra Club\n\nThe reply to the conversation.................................................................................................................................\n\n\nHi Jonathan\n\nI would like to thank you for writing me and taking the time to look into this.\n\nKeep in mind the entire time since the 1 mile bridge has been built water has not flowed South underneath it.\n\nHave Water Management and the National Park explain why they have not flowed water South? This is the first question we should have an answer too. We know it has not flowed South because we have checked it everyday since it's completion.\n\nIn the future when water is available we know the water will flow South. We agree with everybody about this point. But any time it is not flowed South the water will flow North due to not having enough water, being polluted, or during droughts. The bridges are going to allow the South Side to dry up in less than 24 hours during droughts and will cause a shock factor to local wildlife. Even during times when water is flowed South water levels will be so high that wildlife will not have land, and the excessive amounts of water will rot the vegetation destroying our ecosystem.\nThis leads to the second question that needs to be asked and answered. How does Water Management and National Park stop the Northern water flow underneath all this bridging when lock 334 opens and water is flowed South East of the lock, and when lock 333 is closed? This will create a vacuum suction drying out the South Side. A better solution they should look into is putting locks in the place of the 2.6 mile bridge area. This will prevent Northern water flow, and have more control over the water while achieving the Southern water flow in times of need. This scenario might not be as pretty as the view from the top of the concrete bridge, but it sure will save the South side of the Everglades from flooding, and loss of wildlife.This is not something you just slap together because you get some taxpayer money. \n\nSierra Club if you truly care about the Everglades you will get answers for these specific questions and scenarios."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: Lion Guardians is a beautiful project."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

These baby woodpeckers fell to the ground when the rotten tree that their nest was in was pushed over. In this miraculous story of compassion, Captain Quinn saves the baby birds.\nTranscript: Captain Quinn here. Saving baby birds. Yeah, that's right. Woodpecker, to be exact. Baby woodpeckers. Flickers, to be even more specific. So about a week ago, I was building this chicken coop here, which happens to be crookeder than a witch's nose, but we won't get hung up on that. The chickens don't care. And I noticed this rotten old birch tree, and it was a complete safety hazard. So I pushed it over with my muscles, and when it hit the ground, it exploded right in the center. And I heard, squawk, squawk, squawk! And I looked, and there were seven baby woodpeckers. So I felt terrible, decided I had to do something. You know, like, they have just as much a right to be here as I do. So I gathered them all up in my warm embrace, put them in a shoebox, kept them warm in a dark place, and then did a little research, called an animal rescue helpline, and found out that I can either feed them a diluted mixture of cat food and plain yogurt every half an hour. Well, that's not going to happen. Or I can drive them the two and a half hours to the closest animal rescue shelter. That's also not going to happen. Or, their best chance at survival is to actually put them back in their nest, and put that nest back to where it originally was, so the parents can find them. You see, birds have a very poor sense of smell, but they have a very, very strong bond between the parents and the offspring, just like every other animal, which is pretty powerful, a bond that can't be broken easily. So I decided to reconstruct their nest, put them back in, hoist them back up to roughly the same spot, and see if the parents would come back. The problem was, the nest was in shatters, about 50 different pieces. But, I'm a crafty man, so I grabbed all the pieces, a few screws, hammered the screws into the old rotten tree, and duct taped around it with this clear duct tape, packing tape I think, and put the little critters back in, and tied a rope around the top of the rotten snag, and hoisted her back up, and waited. 15 minutes later, to my delight, one of the parents came back, and went right back in the little hole, and fed their little, you know, their offspring, the little babies. I've been observing these birds for about a week now, and it's pretty magnificent. About every 10 to 20 minutes, one of the parents, the mom or the dad, come back with food. They feed the little youngsters, and then they clean up the nest. They fly out, they're busy, they're at it all day. And it's been very cool getting to watch that. Pretty exciting. And they don't mind having chickens as neighbors, and they don't mind me as a spectator. So, it's been pretty cool. And it's been about a week. They've feathered up, and I check on them every day. They come over here to their home, and I, you know, I just tell them, you know, how are you guys doing? And as you can hear, they're quite little chatterboxes. There's a little hole in here I left so I could peek on them, see how they're doing. They're getting feathers. How are you guys doing? When are you planning on leaving the nest? Huh? Huh? About that time, I think. Oh, hi! I'm now, for scientific purposes, so we can get a better understanding of what exactly goes down in a woodpecker's nest, going to stick the pecker cam down inside Woody Woodpecker's hole. No, this is not a colonoscopy. See, woodpeckers, unlike other birds, have their nests inside hollow, rotten trees. I think, I'm not exactly sure what their plan is here. I don't know if they're going to peck their way out of there or climb up and jump. I'm not sure, but I'll keep you posted on that. But I just thought that, you know, if I can save a baby bird, then so can you. And sometimes, as we are being human and doing human things, we put the lives of animals at risk, and I think that we need to remember that they have a right to be here, just as much, if not more so, than us. So if we do find ourselves in a position where we have jeopardized the life of another living animal, I think we should do everything we can to save it and protect it. I'm Captain Quinn, and that's how to save a baby bird. See you next time.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Winter Squirrel Hunting Winter squirrel hunting is a challenging and underutilized sport in Kansas. Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five. I'm Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism.\nComment: Great vid.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: I said this in my speech in tigers once. I was so happy i could educate everyone on it. ^_^"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Walking around you can gaze upon some of the more amazing animals from around the world. From some of the largest to the downright deadly. Zoos offer the average Joe, and his family, a glimpse into the wonders of the natural world. The zoo can trace its origins back to a more family unfriendly time, to ancient Egypt, when for the pharaoh, owning a hippo zoo was completely normal. It was only into the 19th century when the roaring industrial masses wanted a piece of the action, and science was taking off that the modern zoo was born. And sure, zoos have received bad press in the past, but the modern zoo has been reinvented as a centre of science and conservation. So what are the roles of a modern zoo? Well, roughly speaking, we can divide them into three categories, education, breeding centres, and research. So let's start with education. It's simple really, zoos are a fun and safe place to learn for both kids and adults. The fact is, the animals are real, and you can get up and close to some of the more exotic and threatened creatures from around the world. Every year, 150 million people visit zoos around the world, and it's so important that the next generation is educated and understands the role they play in preserving our planet. Better still, many zoos have education centres with dedicated teams who aim to teach kids about everything from ecosystem services to climate change. Zoos also play an important role as breeding centres. Most zoos these days are part of organisations set up to coordinate breeding programmes and keep standards high. This means your favourite animal like the chimpanzee here is probably part of some national or even international breeding programme. These help zoos maintain genetic diversity and are extremely important for species that are threatened with extinction in the wild. One example is the scimitar-horned oryx. This is a species that became extinct in the wild and only survived in zoos and private collections. It is now part of several international breeding programmes and the hope is one day it will be reintroduced into the wild. And finally, Zoos offer a unique opportunity for biologists. Instead of spending days trying to track down an animal and becoming exhausted in the process, zoos offer a more controlled environment where effective research can be undertaken. Take the devastating disease chytridiomycosis. This has caused dramatic declines and even extinction in at least 200 species of frog. Zoos are actively taking part in research aiming to stop the spread of this disease. Research in zoos contribute to a number of scientific fields including animal behaviour and endocrinology, all ultimately contributing to the conservation of our biodiversity. So sure, a trip to the zoo is a great family day out, but zoos these days aren't there to show off your new hippo. Zoos are centres for conservation, educating the new generation, giving critically endangered species another chance and helping us gather knowledge for the conservation of species and biodiversity.

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

First released by Captain Cook for a food source for the pioneers of this country, the Feral Pig has thrived in our conditions and multiplied to almost plague proportions. Up here in the territory, the good living has seen the Feral Pig population explode. Cape York is probably the first destination most people think of when they think of pig hunting, but up here in the territory, their numbers are just as strong. I've heard of boars up to around 240 kilos being caught in the territory, but between 80 and 100 kilos is a good sized boar. They are an environmental terrorist, destroying vast tracts of land. In the south, they destroy crops and livestock, decimating the income of our already struggling farmers. Up here in the north, they tear our wetlands and national parks to shreds. No wetland has been left untouched. They act as carriers of weeds and exotic diseases, and they tear up the land until it becomes a mess of impassable pig ruts. Anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of driving across them will know what I mean. With a keen sense of smell, excellent hearing, and razor sharp tusks, pigs can be considered as dangerous game. Wounded animals are especially dangerous, and I've had a few close calls with wounded boars. There seems to be a lot of difference in opinion on what is the best calibre of hunting pigs. My opinion is, if it kills them, use it. I've shot them with everything from a .22 to a .375 Ultramag, but the latter can get quite expensive when you look at how many pigs we have up here. The smaller calibres can have problems penetrating the thick fighting pads and mud on the larger boars, so aiming at the base of the ear is your best bet when shooting with a small calibre. When using the bigger calibres, aiming tight behind the shoulder has always yielded good results for me. Herds of 30 or more are not uncommon. A group of animals this large will destroy a patch of dirt bigger than a football field every single food sitting. The feral pig is a real menace, and we as hunters need to do our part.\nComment: Really need to keep these pig numbers down as much as we can.\nThere one of the most descructive feral animals In Australia , infact id say THE worst."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Haha, today I﻿ turn 23!!! Glad to know I'm as old as the cat in this video. :) Flavio - my favorite animal ever. :)\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: Get FREE big cat iBooks and big cat PDF books by Big Cat Rescue at  http://bigcatrescue.org/books/"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

I'd like to introduce Anthony and Steve Moore from Kansas. I've invited them down here to do a little hog hunting. Father and son team, never been hog hunting before, done a lot of deer hunting in our time and we thought we'd try something different and sure appreciate the opportunity to hunt with Michael. You're welcome. Tell you what, let's head to the tree stands and see if we can't get them on a hog. We'll see you there at the stand. Alright, well we finally made it down in here to our stands. As you can tell, it is a muddy mess down here. So when it's time to drag one out that we shoot, it ought to slide out of here pretty easy. Pick you one out. See that one sitting there? Shoot it. That one right there. Good shot. I hit the door. Well, I couldn't tell from here until I saw it kick in. Well, Anthony, that was some good shooting. Looks like that was only 50 yards away and getting closer all the time and the first time you ever shot anything. Thank you, Michael Grandstaff, for this hunt. Alright, well I want to thank you all for coming down here to Texas and I hope you all enjoyed this hog hunt. Yes, we did. It was fantastic even if we didn't get to shoot a hog, just to see that many hogs and see the place was exciting enough. Well, I guess it's time to go to work, huh? Oh yeah, that'll be fun.\nComment: Yes the tree is small, makes for a more challenging hunt, especially when the wind is blowing. We want it easy, but not that easy!! lol.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Man saves cute baby birds | Captain Quinn How to save cute baby birds when they fall out of the nest. These baby woodpeckers fell to the ground when the rotten tree that their nest was in was pushed over. In this miraculous story of compassion, Captain Quinn saves the baby birds.\nTranscript: Captain Quinn here. Saving baby birds. Yeah, that's right. Woodpecker, to be exact. Baby woodpeckers. Flickers, to be even more specific. So about a week ago, I was building this chicken coop here, which happens to be crookeder than a witch's nose, but we won't get hung up on that. The chickens don't care. And I noticed this rotten old birch tree, and it was a complete safety hazard. So I pushed it over with my muscles, and when it hit the ground, it exploded right in the center. And I heard, squawk, squawk, squawk! And I looked, and there were seven baby woodpeckers. So I felt terrible, decided I had to do something. You know, like, they have just as much a right to be here as I do. So I gathered them all up in my warm embrace, put them in a shoebox, kept them warm in a dark place, and then did a little research, called an animal rescue helpline, and found out that I can either feed them a diluted mixture of cat food and plain yogurt every half an hour. Well, that's not going to happen. Or I can drive them the two and a half hours to the closest animal rescue shelter. That's also not going to happen. Or, their best chance at survival is to actually put them back in their nest, and put that nest back to where it originally was, so the parents can find them. You see, birds have a very poor sense of smell, but they have a very, very strong bond between the parents and the offspring, just like every other animal, which is pretty powerful, a bond that can't be broken easily. So I decided to reconstruct their nest, put them back in, hoist them back up to roughly the same spot, and see if the parents would come back. The problem was, the nest was in shatters, about 50 different pieces. But, I'm a crafty man, so I grabbed all the pieces, a few screws, hammered the screws into the old rotten tree, and duct taped around it with this clear duct tape, packing tape I think, and put the little critters back in, and tied a rope around the top of the rotten snag, and hoisted her back up, and waited. 15 minutes later, to my delight, one of the parents came back, and went right back in the little hole, and fed their little, you know, their offspring, the little babies. I've been observing these birds for about a week now, and it's pretty magnificent. About every 10 to 20 minutes, one of the parents, the mom or the dad, come back with food. They feed the little youngsters, and then they clean up the nest. They fly out, they're busy, they're at it all day. And it's been very cool getting to watch that. Pretty exciting. And they don't mind having chickens as neighbors, and they don't mind me as a spectator. So, it's been pretty cool. And it's been about a week. They've feathered up, and I check on them every day. They come over here to their home, and I, you know, I just tell them, you know, how are you guys doing? And as you can hear, they're quite little chatterboxes. There's a little hole in here I left so I could peek on them, see how they're doing. They're getting feathers. How are you guys doing? When are you planning on leaving the nest? Huh? Huh? About that time, I think. Oh, hi! I'm now, for scientific purposes, so we can get a better understanding of what exactly goes down in a woodpecker's nest, going to stick the pecker cam down inside Woody Woodpecker's hole. No, this is not a colonoscopy. See, woodpeckers, unlike other birds, have their nests inside hollow, rotten trees. I think, I'm not exactly sure what their plan is here. I don't know if they're going to peck their way out of there or climb up and jump. I'm not sure, but I'll keep you posted on that. But I just thought that, you know, if I can save a baby bird, then so can you. And sometimes, as we are being human and doing human things, we put the lives of animals at risk, and I think that we need to remember that they have a right to be here, just as much, if not more so, than us. So if we do find ourselves in a position where we have jeopardized the life of another living animal, I think we should do everything we can to save it and protect it. I'm Captain Quinn, and that's how to save a baby bird. See you next time. Don't forget to subscribe and tell your friends.\nComment: ITS REPAIR & PROTECTION."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

All these birds never make it because there's just too many cats around here. This is kind of a messed up situation. I'm about four foot away from this bird and I want to leave them alone so that they can go about their natural way, but as soon as I leave, that cat is going to come and eat this bird. It'll get ate if it doesn't get its flying wings. There's their nest in the lower right hand of the screen. I left that one alone. We shooed away the cats, so hopefully the mama can get this little one that was sitting on that metal ring to fly up in the tree with the others, but you can hear them everywhere.

The Coyote Pack is growing. We just hit 50,000 subscribers and it's all because of you. Yes, you, the audience. Keep sharing the videos because the bigger we get, the bigger the adventures get. Stick around, Question of the Week is coming up next. Welcome back. In case you guys missed last week's Behind the Adventure, make sure you check it out. There's still the chance to win those awesome SOG adventure tools. I got some great questions this past week. The one that really stood out came in from Ray Wong. Ray asks, hey Coyote and the crew, I've been wondering how the Coyote Pack is going to grow in the future. How are we going to make it grow in the future? I'm going to tell you how we're going to make it grow. We're going to make it grow in the future. I've been wondering, how long does it take for you guys to produce one of your typical 10 minute episodes? That's a really great question, Ray. And it's tough to answer that one directly because each episode is different. So the crew and I got together and we talked about this and we kind of came upon the number of 48 collective working hours to make one of the 10 minute episodes that you see every single week. And it's different based on animal and location. But there's three different parts that goes into every single episode. Pre-production, production, and post-production. First, let's talk about the pre-production. And it starts with the internet and with field guides. I do a ton of research about the animals that I might want to encounter. And then I start researching the locations that we can travel to to ultimately encounter these animals. Once I figure out what animal it is we want to go after, we start booking our trip and then production begins. Once we actually get on the ground in a location, it can take us days sometimes to find some of these animals. So it's me, it's Mark, it's Chance, it's Melissa, it's my wildlife biologist Mario, and we'll be out there three, four, five days trying to encounter as many animals as we can. So let's say we're in Arizona, we've put together a list of 15 different animals that we want to encounter. We're not gonna see all 15 of these animals. We might see five of those animals and then we might see four or five that we didn't plan on seeing. I've gotta be ready for any situation and any animal at any point in time, which makes it challenging. Once we're there in the environment, and let's say it's a rattlesnake, and we've encountered the rattlesnake and I've caught the rattlesnake, the catch is obviously the most dangerous part. Once I've got the animal in my hands and under control, the camera team can move in close and we begin filming the presentation segment. After we get all of the footage that we needed in the field, then it goes in to post-production. This is a whole different ballgame. This is where you actually put together the puzzle. Now when we come back from a trip, we have anywhere between, I don't know, maybe 40 and 50 hours worth of footage. Think about that, 40 or 50 hours worth of footage that breaks down into these little seven to 10 minute segments. We begin sifting through all of it, finding the best shots, finding the takes that I don't mess up on, and piecing them together. Then comes the sound effects, then comes the music, then comes the color correction, and ultimately, we have a finished episode that we get to upload to YouTube for everyone out there to enjoy. So again, I'd say in total, to put together one of our typical 10 minute episodes, it probably takes about 48 working hours. That was a fantastic question, Ray. Keep writing in every single week. I'll be out here in the field answering your questions. I'm Coyote Peterson. Be brave, stay wild. We'll see you next week. So for me, this is gonna be one heck of an experience. Even though it's a bear that's been raised in captivity for educational purposes, he's an ambassador for his species, it is still a grizzly bear and deserves an incredible amount of respect. I can see it right over my shoulder here and it is big. You're gonna come hiking through this game trail here across this pass. Have a camera down there getting that perspective. Adam will be coming back from that game trail leading to the bushes. There's good cover there, so we can have somebody back there with him. He's gonna come out as you're passing by and he's gonna startle you and you're gonna turn around and you're gonna do what you're supposed to do.\nComment: Coyote. You need your own tv show.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Top 3 Most Memorable Wild Animal Experiences Spawned from a viewer comment, I discuss 2 (actually 3) of my most memorable animal experiences while in the backcountry. And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: You reverted back to your hillbilly roots with that accent.

She's got a baby in her mouth. Look at that. It's not something you get to see every day. Mama squirrel has a baby. She's just taking it with her. I just ran inside to get the camera so I could get this. Oh, there's a nest right above my head there. There's one up there already. So now I know she has two babies. And I guess she decided that that nest is a better place than the box. And I have a feeling why. I wasn't leaving her alone. I put a bowl of food up there thinking I was doing her a favor. But now I realize that she doesn't want her babies near food. Because the food not only doesn't draw other squirrels, which would be a problem, but it draws other animals. So I made a mistake. I basically kicked her out of the nest box by giving her some food. So I learned something. She has another baby in her mouth right there. I don't know if it's on camera, but I can see it and I don't know where she's going with it. Oh, there's another nest. Look at that. She's just nest hopping with her babies. That's interesting. Well, so far I've seen two babies. That's one. And here she goes. Where did she go? Where'd you go, Mama Bear? There you are. Interesting. Oh, no, she's got a baby again. Look at that. She's trying out different nests. That is the craziest thing. I have never seen a squirrel moving a baby. There she is. She's going back. She's moving it back now. I don't believe it. She's putting it back. And it's just in her mouth and it's not crying or screaming or anything. Now she's putting it back. I don't believe it. I guess the nests weren't good enough. Okay. So now there's one baby back in the wooden box. I suspect she's going to come back here and grab the second one. That is crazy. Here she comes. She just popped out of the box and she's going to come back to where I am and grab the other baby. I know this because I saw her bring it over here. Hey, mama. Now she's going to go up to that nest straight up and get a baby. And I am going to show. Wouldn't it be interesting if these babies were nibblers? Obviously, there's no way to tell such a thing, but that would be cool. There she is. She's at the nest now. I can't tell because I'm looking straight up. I can't tell if the camera can see this. Okay, she's grabbed the baby. And it's in her mouth. Alright, here she comes. Oh my gosh, she's right in front of me. Hey sweetie, it's okay. Go on. Oh, and the baby's just hanging there. Oh, it's so cute. That is so cute. Alright, two babies safe in the box. I'll remember next time. I'm not going to put food up there anymore. Hopefully she keeps them there. Maybe I can tame up another pair of squirrels. That would be so neat.\nComment: You need to turn camera off and go inside. Mama doesn't like the intrusion. This is why she is nest hopping.

The white sticks out, so its chances of being seen by an eagle or a python, a mongoose, a rival predator, are so much greater. The normal coloured cubs, they blend with the forest floor, the leaf litter, the dappled light in the forest, they kind of disappear. The white cub sticks out like a beacon, very very vulnerable, and its colour makes it even more vulnerable. See the white tiger there trying to suckle on the other tiger, instinctive, gets no milk so immediately starts shouting. All three cubs now gone to sleep. Clambering over these rocks has taken it out of them, all their heads going down, little yawns, eyes closing, nice warm rocks, sun dropping now, temperature dropping, and they're all off for a nice little snooze. The number of sounds that I use to communicate with the cubs, I give a little purring sound, this is what a cheetah mother uses with her cubs, see how it calms them down, and then I use the little chuffing sound. See the other cubs are responding to the purr. Today the little cubs, just a month old, have had their first experience of water, and their first swimming experience. Now of all the big cats, tigers love the water the most. They live in areas where there are big monsoon rains, big rivers, and they will swim. In fact, in the Shundabans, they will swim 15 kilometers between the islands hunting for food. Watch how Shine helps Shunda climb out of the water. This is a typical den site that a tigress will use, nice little caves, and in here she can put these little cubs, get them into the crevices, and make it difficult for a rival predator to get inside. Now every few days, she will move those cubs to a new den site. When the scent builds up, the urine, the dung inside the den, it becomes smelly, and she takes the cub and moves it to a den site that she's found somewhere nearby.\nComment: Where is the mother?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

These baby woodpeckers fell to the ground when the rotten tree that their nest was in was pushed over. In this miraculous story of compassion, Captain Quinn saves the baby birds.\nTranscript: Captain Quinn here. Saving baby birds. Yeah, that's right. Woodpecker, to be exact. Baby woodpeckers. Flickers, to be even more specific. So about a week ago, I was building this chicken coop here, which happens to be crookeder than a witch's nose, but we won't get hung up on that. The chickens don't care. And I noticed this rotten old birch tree, and it was a complete safety hazard. So I pushed it over with my muscles, and when it hit the ground, it exploded right in the center. And I heard, squawk, squawk, squawk! And I looked, and there were seven baby woodpeckers. So I felt terrible, decided I had to do something. You know, like, they have just as much a right to be here as I do. So I gathered them all up in my warm embrace, put them in a shoebox, kept them warm in a dark place, and then did a little research, called an animal rescue helpline, and found out that I can either feed them a diluted mixture of cat food and plain yogurt every half an hour. Well, that's not going to happen. Or I can drive them the two and a half hours to the closest animal rescue shelter. That's also not going to happen. Or, their best chance at survival is to actually put them back in their nest, and put that nest back to where it originally was, so the parents can find them. You see, birds have a very poor sense of smell, but they have a very, very strong bond between the parents and the offspring, just like every other animal, which is pretty powerful, a bond that can't be broken easily. So I decided to reconstruct their nest, put them back in, hoist them back up to roughly the same spot, and see if the parents would come back. The problem was, the nest was in shatters, about 50 different pieces. But, I'm a crafty man, so I grabbed all the pieces, a few screws, hammered the screws into the old rotten tree, and duct taped around it with this clear duct tape, packing tape I think, and put the little critters back in, and tied a rope around the top of the rotten snag, and hoisted her back up, and waited. 15 minutes later, to my delight, one of the parents came back, and went right back in the little hole, and fed their little, you know, their offspring, the little babies. I've been observing these birds for about a week now, and it's pretty magnificent. About every 10 to 20 minutes, one of the parents, the mom or the dad, come back with food. They feed the little youngsters, and then they clean up the nest. They fly out, they're busy, they're at it all day. And it's been very cool getting to watch that. Pretty exciting. And they don't mind having chickens as neighbors, and they don't mind me as a spectator. So, it's been pretty cool. And it's been about a week. They've feathered up, and I check on them every day. They come over here to their home, and I, you know, I just tell them, you know, how are you guys doing? And as you can hear, they're quite little chatterboxes. There's a little hole in here I left so I could peek on them, see how they're doing. They're getting feathers. How are you guys doing? When are you planning on leaving the nest? Huh? Huh? About that time, I think. Oh, hi! I'm now, for scientific purposes, so we can get a better understanding of what exactly goes down in a woodpecker's nest, going to stick the pecker cam down inside Woody Woodpecker's hole. No, this is not a colonoscopy. See, woodpeckers, unlike other birds, have their nests inside hollow, rotten trees. I think, I'm not exactly sure what their plan is here. I don't know if they're going to peck their way out of there or climb up and jump. I'm not sure, but I'll keep you posted on that. But I just thought that, you know, if I can save a baby bird, then so can you. And sometimes, as we are being human and doing human things, we put the lives of animals at risk, and I think that we need to remember that they have a right to be here, just as much, if not more so, than us. So if we do find ourselves in a position where we have jeopardized the life of another living animal, I think we should do everything we can to save it and protect it. I'm Captain Quinn, and that's how to save a baby bird. See you next time. Don't forget to subscribe and tell your friends.\nComment: GOD BLESS YOU.. :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Watch as wildlife managers count Mexican wolves to find out if 2014 is a record-breaking year. This video was created by the Information Branch of the Arizona Game and Fish Dept. Producer: David Majure.\nTranscript: December 2014 in the White Mountains of Arizona, a trail cam placed near the carcass of an elk records a pack of Mexican wolves showing up for breakfast. It's nothing unusual, yet it's absolutely extraordinary, especially when you consider that Mexican wolves nearly became extinct. By the early 1970s, there were zero wild Mexican wolves in the United States, and only a smattering could still be found in Mexico. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Mexican wolf as an endangered species in 1976. Today, Mexican wolves are making a comeback in Arizona and New Mexico, thanks to a captive breeding program and a reintroduction project that's been releasing and managing wolves since 1998. It's a partnership between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the Forest Service, the White Mountain Apache Tribe, and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. From the get-go, the goal was a self-sustaining population of at least 100 wolves by 2006. It's taken us almost 10 years after that to even come close to that number. Go find a location on RIM, go find Tsewa, only you're going to be over there on White Mountain. Jeff Dolphin is team leader for Arizona Game and Fish on the interagency field team, which does the day-to-day management of this experimental population of Mexican wolves. Does anybody not know what they're doing tomorrow? At the end of each year, the team does a population survey to find out how many wolves are living in the wild. We've got 10 animals, we're just trying to find 1331. The front seat can just turn the antenna and find the wolf just by turning it that way. They use radio telemetry to search for wolves wearing radio collars. When they find a wolf without a collar, or one that needs a new one, they may try to capture it. Chasing wolves through tall trees in a helicopter is difficult. It's probably some of the most demanding flying I do, just between the terrain, the trees, and trying to follow a running wolf through the trees without running into anything. It's very demanding. And sticking it with a tranquilizer dart is never easy. I'm looking out of the helicopter or muggers on the side trying to locate the wolves with the radio telemetry. What you're witnessing is wildlife management in action. It's unbelievably challenging. You just got to be patient and persistent. And it's infinitely rewarding. All of these wolves right now are wild born, wild raised, and they're surviving on their own. They're not needing help to survive from us. They're doing what we want them to do, but we're really seeing a dramatic incline in the population right now. When a wolf is delivered, the processing team goes to work immediately. Who's doing the microchips? This animal came in pretty hot from the chase and everything else, and through the IV fluids and cold packs, we've actually got her temperature back down to normal. The team documents the wolf's physical characteristics. It provides immunizations, monitors vital signs, and does any doctoring that's needed. So this is pretty much a resolving bite wound. The priority is to get the animal collared and back into the wild as soon and as safely as possible. For three straight years, the Mexican wolf population has increased by at least 10%. But this year's count was better than ever. The 2014 Mexican wolf population survey documented a minimum of 109 wolves in the wild, a 31% increase that finally broke the century mark. We're busting at the seams with wolves right now for this recovery area. With 19 packs and 38 pups, the future is bright for Mexican wolves. And it's only getting brighter. In 2015, big changes to the rules governing the recovery efforts gave Mexican wolves more room to roam. The area they're allowed to occupy in Arizona and New Mexico grew from 7,000 to more than 150,000 square miles. And the goal for the number of wolves more than tripled, from 100 to as many as 325. It's a number the project partners believe will give the wolves the greatest chance of success. A number that strikes a balance between the wolf population, available prey resources, and public acceptance. A number that ensures the Mexican wolf's comeback continues.\nComment: I am so happy that the mexican wolves are in the wild and more and more are coming god bless the people who saved this wolf species"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This footage was shot at beautiful Animal Kingdom (Disney) in Orlando, Fl.\nTranscript: The large flying fox is one of the biggest bats in the world. Even though it may weigh, on average, only two pounds, its wingspan can get to around six feet wide. That is one of the reasons this bat belongs to the suborder, megabat. Or as I say, the suborder, MEGABAT! These large bats are just one of many species of flying fox. They get their name due to their heads, which up close, sort of look like a fox with their pointed ears. These large flying fox come from the islands of Southeast Asia. They will roost high up in the trees and they will become active at sunrise and at sunset. So they aren't strictly nocturnal. And since they're considered an old world bat, they also can't echolocate like some other bats can. So they rely on their sense of smell and strong eyesight to locate food. Food for these large bats is pollen, leaves, flowers, and fruits. So you don't have to worry, they're not going to suck your blood. They play an important role where they can take fruit seeds from one island to another to help the fruits grow in new locations. Now unfortunately, they are often seen as pests since they eat flowers and they then are over hunted. These large flying foxes also need a lot of trees and in Southeast Asia, a lot of forests and jungles are being cut down due to the growing human population and a need for more space. The flying fox will usually give birth to just one pup so it's very important to conserve each and every large bat we see. Their young will stay with them for around 12 to 14 weeks and then they become mature enough to go out on their own. For more information on the flying fox, please read this video's description below. And as always, thanks for watching!\nComment: That's terrible! I think these bats are adorable, and they're clearly innocuous! Why are we so often a vile species of bullies? Thank you for trying to spread awareness about these bats!

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: I'm on the southern edge of the Namib Desert. Here, plants can't get water not because it's frozen, but because rain hardly ever falls, only about one or two inches in the whole year. Most of the time, it's bone dry and devastatingly hot. Yet, almost unbelievably, there are trees standing out in the sands, totally unsheltered, with no sign of moisture anywhere around them. Water storage is the great trick here. These green succulent leaves are full of it, and so are these bloated branches. The local bushmen used to cut off these branches and hollow out the spongy tissue and use them as containers for their arrows, which is why this tree is called the quiver tree. Its branches are covered with a blindingly white powder which reflects the heat, and its leaves have thick rinds with very few pores, which minimizes the amount of water they lose through evaporation. The trunk, even of an old tree ravaged by the years, remains smooth and impermeable, but even the quiver tree can't seal itself off totally from its surroundings. Living involves breathing, and some water vapour is inevitably lost in that process. But this tree has a way of reducing that. Self-amputation. It can cut off a leaf rosette and seal the stump.

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

This is Wendy the Guide Girl, also known as Hawk Hunter Diva if you're watching YouTube. I'm sitting in my own back pasture instead of down at the leaves, shopping for some venison. I haven't seen anything I wanted to fling an arrow at yet. I'm in the antler hunting mode. So I got some new stuff from Buzzy. It's called Bowhunter Setup Scrape Juice. So I'm going to test that out today and see if I can't bring in something new. I see something just jumped the fence and I haven't seen it before. So let's check it out and see if he's a shooter. Well, good evening. Welcome to Butch and Wendy's Hunting Adventures. Hawk Hunter Diva decided to go try to get some venison. So we're here in the Hill Country, Texas. The deer are a little smaller up here compared to South Texas or up north, but we have a whole lot of them. I've been sitting in a pop-up blind watching a stream of does and little bucks and stuff. And I was actually after this eight point buck. He was nice and mature, but he didn't come in this morning. And while I was sitting there, this little ten point came in. Well, for the Hill Country, he's a nice little deer. And I decided to go ahead and take him. I had a good hunt. It was nice. And another deal was, the wind wasn't quite blowing right. It's kind of switching around because we have a front coming in. Right now it's 76 degrees here in Central Texas, but tomorrow it's going to be 35 degrees. So actually I was even hunting in shorts this evening. But anyway, the wind was swirling. The deer kept coming in. They were a little spooky. So I'll tell you what I did. I got this Muzzy's Bowhunter set up, the scrape juice, and I sprayed a little bit out the window. And he came in shortly afterwards, but I'll tell you what, don't spray it inside the blind. It smells pretty rough, but I bet deer really like it because I had never seen this buck before out of all the deer I've been watching for the past couple of weeks. And it brought him in, so I guess it works. But have a good evening. Muzzy Phantom did the job, shot him with a crossbow. Central Hill Country of Texas, and it's October 27th, 2010. Y'all have a good evening. We're going to try to go get some more venison here this season, but I guess I'm going to have to change clothes and get something warm. See y'all next time. Later.\nComment: That was a great video Wendy and congrats on that nice Hill Country 10 point right there!! Man, the weather is good right now and the bucks are really on the move here in the Hill Country...love this time of the season!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5. Mention any of the information that I wrote about above or anything I may have forgotten.Remember, please be polite but state your case.  This is the only chance we have and time is ticking away.  Please share this video with all of your animal loving friends and MAKE THAT CALL ASAP.Is this the change that the majority of Americans voted for in November?\nTranscript: you you you you you you you you you you\nComment: I dare you to watch Undue Burden, By: Bruce Hemming.

We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around.\nComment: @CyprusHot  Ok now you're bringing GOD in to this? Have some respect.

I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: I love how the bower birds are so fussy  and tweaky, it's funny. \n No  this thing doesn't go here, I must move it over there.. no, that's not right, moving it to this other place until it's just right, it's VERY VERY important !"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The lionesses haven't made a successful kill in days. All three are producing milk. They need to replenish their reserves. Kali splits off from the pride, while mother and Ani hide the cubs. She heads to a narrow island that sits just above the water table. In winter, grass above the water line dries out. It's perfect camouflage for a tawny coat. And dry ground is the lechwe's achilles heel, the long hooves that make them fast in the water slow them down on terra firma. The lioness can clock nearly 40 miles per hour on hard ground, but she can only sprint for 100 yards. She has to close the gap between them before she attacks. Kali's impatient. She closes in too fast. The lechwe uses the head start to bolt for the water. Again, the swamp defeats her.\nComment: no!!!!!!!!!!!!only cheetah can chalenge impalas running"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Walking around you can gaze upon some of the more amazing animals from around the world. From some of the largest to the downright deadly. Zoos offer the average Joe, and his family, a glimpse into the wonders of the natural world. The zoo can trace its origins back to a more family unfriendly time, to ancient Egypt, when for the pharaoh, owning a hippo zoo was completely normal. It was only into the 19th century when the roaring industrial masses wanted a piece of the action, and science was taking off that the modern zoo was born. And sure, zoos have received bad press in the past, but the modern zoo has been reinvented as a centre of science and conservation. So what are the roles of a modern zoo? Well, roughly speaking, we can divide them into three categories, education, breeding centres, and research. So let's start with education. It's simple really, zoos are a fun and safe place to learn for both kids and adults. The fact is, the animals are real, and you can get up and close to some of the more exotic and threatened creatures from around the world. Every year, 150 million people visit zoos around the world, and it's so important that the next generation is educated and understands the role they play in preserving our planet. Better still, many zoos have education centres with dedicated teams who aim to teach kids about everything from ecosystem services to climate change. Zoos also play an important role as breeding centres. Most zoos these days are part of organisations set up to coordinate breeding programmes and keep standards high. This means your favourite animal like the chimpanzee here is probably part of some national or even international breeding programme. These help zoos maintain genetic diversity and are extremely important for species that are threatened with extinction in the wild. One example is the scimitar-horned oryx. This is a species that became extinct in the wild and only survived in zoos and private collections. It is now part of several international breeding programmes and the hope is one day it will be reintroduced into the wild. And finally, Zoos offer a unique opportunity for biologists. Instead of spending days trying to track down an animal and becoming exhausted in the process, zoos offer a more controlled environment where effective research can be undertaken. Take the devastating disease chytridiomycosis. This has caused dramatic declines and even extinction in at least 200 species of frog. Zoos are actively taking part in research aiming to stop the spread of this disease. Research in zoos contribute to a number of scientific fields including animal behaviour and endocrinology, all ultimately contributing to the conservation of our biodiversity. So sure, a trip to the zoo is a great family day out, but zoos these days aren't there to show off your new hippo. Zoos are centres for conservation, educating the new generation, giving critically endangered species another chance and helping us gather knowledge for the conservation of species and biodiversity.

We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around.\nComment: @CyprusHot And yes I have done research on this subject, that's why I came across this video. I understand that Bears charge because they're afraid. I understand that. But when you passionately say \"they're just scared\" what do you suggest the people do then? Stand there and say \"Well, we are in their land, so I guess we'll have to let yogi here kill us.\" Don't you see that's absurd?

They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them.

The white sticks out, so its chances of being seen by an eagle or a python, a mongoose, a rival predator, are so much greater. The normal coloured cubs, they blend with the forest floor, the leaf litter, the dappled light in the forest, they kind of disappear. The white cub sticks out like a beacon, very very vulnerable, and its colour makes it even more vulnerable. See the white tiger there trying to suckle on the other tiger, instinctive, gets no milk so immediately starts shouting. All three cubs now gone to sleep. Clambering over these rocks has taken it out of them, all their heads going down, little yawns, eyes closing, nice warm rocks, sun dropping now, temperature dropping, and they're all off for a nice little snooze. The number of sounds that I use to communicate with the cubs, I give a little purring sound, this is what a cheetah mother uses with her cubs, see how it calms them down, and then I use the little chuffing sound. See the other cubs are responding to the purr. Today the little cubs, just a month old, have had their first experience of water, and their first swimming experience. Now of all the big cats, tigers love the water the most. They live in areas where there are big monsoon rains, big rivers, and they will swim. In fact, in the Shundabans, they will swim 15 kilometers between the islands hunting for food. Watch how Shine helps Shunda climb out of the water. This is a typical den site that a tigress will use, nice little caves, and in here she can put these little cubs, get them into the crevices, and make it difficult for a rival predator to get inside. Now every few days, she will move those cubs to a new den site. When the scent builds up, the urine, the dung inside the den, it becomes smelly, and she takes the cub and moves it to a den site that she's found somewhere nearby.\nComment: Hi John.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Yes, this would be great our two largest enclosures (3 acres and 1 acre) have access to a section of the lake each, but to do this for our other tiger enclosures would take a lot of time and money both of which we do not have. Plus maintenance of that many enclosures that are submerged into the lake would be time consuming as well, all of our tigers have access to at least one pool, Flavio has two :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Join Todd Graf and Dean Kreuger both shoot trophy whitetail bucks and have to back out before recovering them the next day.  The rut continues right here on Bowhunt or Die!\nTranscript: Bowhunter Dye is being brought to you by Matthews, Lost Camo, New Archery Products, J.B. Tinks, Lone Wolf Portable Tree Stands, Scent Blocker, Campbell Cameras, and Stealth Cam. Welcome to another action-packed episode of Bowhunter Dye. I'm Justin Zarr and alongside me as always is Todd Graff. You know, Todd, we've got two more really exciting buck hunts to share with our audience this week. We do. You know, it's been a great year. I've been fortunate enough to harvest my second buck here in Illinois. It's a buck's name is Captain Hook. It turned out to be quite the adventure on the recovery but it did work out okay in the end. Yeah, you know, I actually got to play a little part in that recovery but, you know, last week we talked about backing out after an unsure hit which is what you did and actually the other buck that we're going to feature this week which came from Dean Krieger, kind of the same scenario. He was a little bit unsure of the hit so he backed out and, you know, fortunately was able to recover his buck the next day. Right, you know, it's difficult to pull out. It makes really for a sick sleeping evening but in the end it is the smartest thing to do. Well, let's jump right in a tree with Todd on his hunt for Captain Hook. Beautiful buck. I don't know if he went down over there or not, guys. I made a nice Tony Vineyard shot. It looked to me to be a good shot. Oh, he popped right out of this corn. Scared those two smaller bucks away. I'm gonna have to re-watch the footage. I don't know how good of a shot I made or didn't make. I mean, it looked like it wasn't bad but he just didn't act the way I wanted him to act. I may have only got one lung. Let's get out of here. I've learned from experience when you find yourself in situations you just gotta back out, be calm, don't disturb the area. Hopefully he will not go far and he'll expire. Well, the Calvary has arrived. Mike and Justin just showed up. They're not hunting that far away from here so luckily they were able to come give me a hand. You know, that buck came in and I blew it. There's no question about it. I could have been a little bit more calm and I shouldn't have punched the trigger like the way I did. That buck was totally calm. I should have just gave him two more steps and I would have probably had a much better broadside double lung shot but you know what? We did all the stuff right. We pulled out. It's been over four and a half hours now so we're gonna go over at the point of impact, see if we can find my arrow. I'm pretty positive it was a pass through. We've watched the footage over and over and over. He went about 30-40 yards and just stood there for a while so let's see what we can find. I'm hoping that this buck didn't go too far. Let's take a look. We got some blood right here guys. I mean there hasn't been a lot of blood but we're still on the trail so that definitely makes me feel better. We just jumped him. That's not a good sign. That's enough to make you sick right there guys. Wait until tomorrow on this one. I'm here with my friend Scott Hill. He's my neighbor. You know what? It's so great when you got good neighbors when you own hunting property. There's nothing better and more valuable than a good neighbor. Scott was nice enough to, actually he was super nice. He left his wife go hunting this morning and he came out here and helped me track. You know, he went about another 100 yards. We found about four more beds. We just came up around the hill over here and there he is. He's laying right over there. He must have just went up the hill and then came back down. Oh my gosh guys. What an awesome looking deer. Come on take a look at this buck. It's November 7th. You know what? I found my buck, thank goodness, this morning. I shot him yesterday morning. I had great footage. You know, the buck came right in. Unfortunately, I made a mistake. I should have gave that buck at least a couple more seconds and he probably would have turned broadside to me. He's a good four and a half year old. Nice brown horns, heavy mass. He's got this really unique right side. There's nothing better than shooting a freak buck. I can't wait to check my stealth cams out. I'm hoping I got a couple videos up because this is really a good looking buck. He's just a good heavy horn. Nice looking buck. I am extremely happy. I am tagged out in Illinois. I'm going to head now to Wisconsin. I've got two tags left in Wisconsin. I'm going to head up there and see what I can get done in Wisconsin. It's been three years since I put one down up there.\nComment: Awesome video, thanks for bringing us the best!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

I can already hear the birds in the background and I hear they've got a few of these babies as well. So I'm excited. Let's go check it out. The Wildlife Sanctuary was built in 1975 to protect rare Arabian species such as the Oryx, Adex and Reem gazelle. Now the park has over 1,000 species of animals including exotic birds, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas and even a few giraffes. Visitors to the park pay about 1 dinar for a tour and overview of the facilities. The tour includes a short video of the wildlife in the area and a bus ride through the reserve. So we're at the carnivorous complex now. Could you tell us about the animals that live here? We have here the Arabian leopard. This Arabian leopard is a very dangerous species and we have also the Arabian wolf. He is endangered and the caracal is a very endangered species and cheetah also. We're going into the cheetah cage right now. I'm just a little bit nervous. Oh, more birds. Don't, don't tease me. Don't tease me. Don't tease me. Please don't do that. Please don't do that.

I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around.\nComment: Silly comments. First off congrats you two are still alive.  Second there is no shame just shooting a charging bear.  There is no need to check off a list of bear spray or not. You have an animal capable and intending to rip you apart when they are charging. So shoot the damn thing between the eyes without batting an eyelash. If you survive to tell the tale, good for you.  So many are not so lucky.  Bears are not bad, they are bears, and they are wild.  There is no fairytale story.  If you are getting charged from a brown bear that is not a good thing at all for you. And yes mankind can still enjoy wildlife and these amazing creatures taking all precautions to prevent this type of thing to occur. Even with taking all necessary precautions, this can still happen. Thankfully the two here were prepared so they can live to tell the tail."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: @BeaverCreekHome At first when we started driving through the wildlife loop here I thought we would only see a few animals here and there but I was amazed at what we saw and how the Buffalo heard just kept coming and coming over the mountain.

The Coyote Pack is growing. We just hit 50,000 subscribers and it's all because of you. Yes, you, the audience. Keep sharing the videos because the bigger we get, the bigger the adventures get. Stick around, Question of the Week is coming up next. Welcome back. In case you guys missed last week's Behind the Adventure, make sure you check it out. There's still the chance to win those awesome SOG adventure tools. I got some great questions this past week. The one that really stood out came in from Ray Wong. Ray asks, hey Coyote and the crew, I've been wondering how the Coyote Pack is going to grow in the future. How are we going to make it grow in the future? I'm going to tell you how we're going to make it grow. We're going to make it grow in the future. I've been wondering, how long does it take for you guys to produce one of your typical 10 minute episodes? That's a really great question, Ray. And it's tough to answer that one directly because each episode is different. So the crew and I got together and we talked about this and we kind of came upon the number of 48 collective working hours to make one of the 10 minute episodes that you see every single week. And it's different based on animal and location. But there's three different parts that goes into every single episode. Pre-production, production, and post-production. First, let's talk about the pre-production. And it starts with the internet and with field guides. I do a ton of research about the animals that I might want to encounter. And then I start researching the locations that we can travel to to ultimately encounter these animals. Once I figure out what animal it is we want to go after, we start booking our trip and then production begins. Once we actually get on the ground in a location, it can take us days sometimes to find some of these animals. So it's me, it's Mark, it's Chance, it's Melissa, it's my wildlife biologist Mario, and we'll be out there three, four, five days trying to encounter as many animals as we can. So let's say we're in Arizona, we've put together a list of 15 different animals that we want to encounter. We're not gonna see all 15 of these animals. We might see five of those animals and then we might see four or five that we didn't plan on seeing. I've gotta be ready for any situation and any animal at any point in time, which makes it challenging. Once we're there in the environment, and let's say it's a rattlesnake, and we've encountered the rattlesnake and I've caught the rattlesnake, the catch is obviously the most dangerous part. Once I've got the animal in my hands and under control, the camera team can move in close and we begin filming the presentation segment. After we get all of the footage that we needed in the field, then it goes in to post-production. This is a whole different ballgame. This is where you actually put together the puzzle. Now when we come back from a trip, we have anywhere between, I don't know, maybe 40 and 50 hours worth of footage. Think about that, 40 or 50 hours worth of footage that breaks down into these little seven to 10 minute segments. We begin sifting through all of it, finding the best shots, finding the takes that I don't mess up on, and piecing them together. Then comes the sound effects, then comes the music, then comes the color correction, and ultimately, we have a finished episode that we get to upload to YouTube for everyone out there to enjoy. So again, I'd say in total, to put together one of our typical 10 minute episodes, it probably takes about 48 working hours. That was a fantastic question, Ray. Keep writing in every single week. I'll be out here in the field answering your questions. I'm Coyote Peterson. Be brave, stay wild. We'll see you next week. So for me, this is gonna be one heck of an experience. Even though it's a bear that's been raised in captivity for educational purposes, he's an ambassador for his species, it is still a grizzly bear and deserves an incredible amount of respect. I can see it right over my shoulder here and it is big. You're gonna come hiking through this game trail here across this pass. Have a camera down there getting that perspective. Adam will be coming back from that game trail leading to the bushes. There's good cover there, so we can have somebody back there with him. He's gonna come out as you're passing by and he's gonna startle you and you're gonna turn around and you're gonna do what you're supposed to do.\nComment: Why don't you make 30-60 minute episodes instead of 10 minutes?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Hi, Rebecca! There's a camper and the Jeep and that's the lake. That's Muska Lounge Lake. Notice how there's not people on top of people on top of people. I guess, I never showed you guys that at the other campground. Anyway, this is a nice campground. And look, grass, not dirt. The campground that we stayed at last weekend, it was all dirt. Every single campsite was dirt. Which is just crazy. So, we're getting ready to head on the road. Head on the road. We're gonna head on the road? Head on the road. Whatever. So, we just left the campground and we are headed to Oswald's Bear Ranch. They have the north, I think the largest collection of black bears, is it? Probably. Largest collection of black bears in the United States. Or at least like on this side of the United States. Cause we were at a black bear ranch one time out west and they had a lot of bears too. I think they had a large collection of bears though, not just black bears. Yeah, I think they had like grizzly bears. Yeah, they had a Kodiak. I remember that. And this guy just has just black bears. So, we're gonna go see some bears. Not you girls. You girls are gonna have to sit in the car with the air conditioner on for a little bit. That's why we have two sets of keys. We're at the bear ranch. There's their dens. And way back there we see a bear. These are the female bears, I believe. There's a big bear right there. Just a walking. They just remind me of dogs. Imagine what it sounds like when they get all playing. Yeah. Probably like Shelby and Oakley. Yeah. Look a bear, panting just like the dogs. We don't have any apples. We didn't buy any apples yet. And don't look like he needs many apples. Pretty cool. What's up dude? What's up? Are you hot? I think these are the females he said. Yeah, and she looks like she could be pregnant. No, they're getting ready for hibernation, Jamie. Oh, that's right. Man, looks like an apple. There's that one sleeping under a tree. There's another one walking down here. I think they said there's seven in this enclosure. They have 29 all together here. Look, another bear. This one just sat down to stare at Rebecca. What do you think, Rebecca? You ever been that close to a bear? No. What are you doing, huh? Just chilling out in there? Just chilling out. She's a little smaller than the last one. Yeah, she is. Oh, look at this one. It reminds me of Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh. Kind of hanging out. Is that comfortable? Sure looks comfortable. Are you a boy? No, that's a girl. Them other ones must have been boys. Look how little she is. She's just a-walking. Looking for food. Here she goes. Looking away. Looking away. She makes a loop. And eyes. Boom. She's looking for an apple. Yeah, she wants to make sure it's not up here. Let's keep walking. We'll go find more. There's lots more. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one here's sitting up. He's like, Oh, but I wanted an apple. Those people are feeding the bears apples. So they're going to follow them all the way around. They're going to try to anyway. Uh-huh. This one's playing in the water. Didn't think he was going to. Look. King of the mountain. Yep, always balancing. He's going to lay right down in the water. Oh, I bet that feels good. That's funny. Both of them are like, Slowly going. How cool is that? So, where are we? The bear pen. Oswald, the bear pen. Bear pen. Oswald's bear ranch. In Newberry. In Newberry. Yep. Got Rebecca. And a big fence. There's bears in there. There's bears in there. I got some on my list down there too. There's big male bears in there somewhere. Yeah, there's a couple ten year old black bears in here. I don't know. Where are we going next? Fayette. Fayette? Way down to Fayette? I don't know. Are we going to stop there first? Probably stop somewhere first. I have no idea. Uh, seen? Wildlife refuge? Maybe. Maybe we'll do that on the way back for that time. Maybe. Anyway. I was just wondering why I brought this camera. So now you can clip this out. Bye. More bears. I think that was the one we just saw swimming. Oh look, he's going to climb the tree. There he goes. You can do it dude. Get it, get it, get it. It's not as little as it used to be. These are juvenile bears. They're playing back there. Want it? There's your little big truck bear. Come on. Yeah, I think he's a little big for up there. There's one big bear. Check him out. He's pretty big. Well, there's a big boy. What's up big boy? There's another big boy back there. Yeah. The claws will kill you. Oh, big yawn. Oh, baby yawn. What's up, huh? Oh, you gotta get up, huh? Gotta move. No, you can stay. No, that one's yawning. I'm tired too. We're leaving. I hit the camera. We're leaving Oswald's Bear Ranch and now we're heading down to Newberry. That was pretty cool. If you're ever up here and you're thinking about whether or not you should stop, you should stop. Cause I had fun. Did you have fun? I had fun. Did you have fun, Rebecca? Yes, I had fun. And the dogs did well sitting in the car. We didn't leave them for too long. So, on to Newberry, I guess. It was neat to see all the bears playing. Yeah, we got some cool video we'll show you guys. And I guess if you're gonna go, you gotta go early in the morning while they're out moving around. Yeah, cause once it gets hot, they're not... They don't like to be out. Why are you in my face? Put in my face. Jamie's outside putting air in the camper tires and the Jeep tires. We got one dog. We got two dogs. We got all three dogs. There's camper. Can't see it cause the window's really dirty. There's Jamie. He just put air in the tires. And we're just about ready to get on the road to go up north for camping.\nComment: That was so cool the wild animal I want to see is a wolf I like bears to the black bear is the cutest do they look like a Ruttweiler"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: And this is the work of the master builder among bower birds. I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: life is such an amazing blessing"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: Please, go to BigcatRescue. org and do a search on the site for \"white tigers\" to see more detailed information white tigers and see some white tiger photos, too."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

Now the park has over 1,000 species of animals including exotic birds, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas and even a few giraffes. Visitors to the park pay about 1 dinar for a tour and overview of the facilities. The tour includes a short video of the wildlife in the area and a bus ride through the reserve. So we're at the carnivorous complex now. Could you tell us about the animals that live here? We have here the Arabian leopard. This Arabian leopard is a very dangerous species and we have also the Arabian wolf. He is endangered and the caracal is a very endangered species and cheetah also.

How was the shot? I was in the brush. Dude... It sounded solid. Dude, I saw it penetrate right up to the fletches, man. I think I went in a little back, but he was quartered towards the front shoulder. I think it was a solid, solid shot. I don't think he went far. It didn't sound like it the way he was crashing.

We're going to take a couple minutes here, relax, let him lay, and go see what we got, see if we can put our hands on him. Whew! Well, we waited a little while. We heard him crash. We know he went down really quick. There's blood right at the scene of the crime. So we're just going to follow it out real easy here, and I don't think he went far.

Fascinating insight into the private life of these colourful birds from BBC wildlife show 'Jungle'.This is a channel from BBC Studios who help fund new BBC programmes. Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: For hornbills, finding the right tree is crucial to survival. They need a roomy nesting hole, usually made when a large branch falls off a mature tree, which doesn't happen very often. Scientists have installed surveillance cameras into nest holes like this, to get an intimate, kind of big-brother view into the private lives of hornbills. These unique pictures show a female hornbill making herself at home. She needs to feel as comfortable as possible, because she's going to be a prisoner in here for up to four months. Once in, she starts preparing to seal up the door. She's plugging the entrance with mud, pieces of wood and sticky fruit, and leaving just a very narrow slit. And the reason why she shuts herself away is to lay her egg and protect her chick. From now on, she'll depend entirely on her partner to survive. He makes about ten or more runs a day, bringing back about a kilogram of food, a varied diet of fruit, insects, small reptiles and young birds. He stores it in his throat, and once back at the nest, regurgitates it for his family. With such intensive care, the chick grows fast, and eats mum out of house and home. After five weeks, there's only room inside the hole for him. Once a pair have found their ideal home, they'll keep on coming back for years. So trees like this are critical to the survival of these endangered birds. If this nest isn't available next year, this chick's parents may never find another.\nComment: Im currently doing a project on the conservation of Oriental Pied Hornbills in Singapore and this video has been of great help!

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over.

Servals are amazing, but they're from Africa and the Sahara. So what's it doing here in beautiful Sherwood, Oregon? I'll tell you, as I was saying, many assholes out there think it's okay to raise an exotic animal. And they have no prior experience, and it's just horrible.

I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: @my35Xvision Thanks You!

Hi, Rebecca! There's a camper and the Jeep and that's the lake. That's Muska Lounge Lake. Notice how there's not people on top of people on top of people. I guess, I never showed you guys that at the other campground. Anyway, this is a nice campground. And look, grass, not dirt. The campground that we stayed at last weekend, it was all dirt. Every single campsite was dirt. Which is just crazy. So, we're getting ready to head on the road. Head on the road. We're gonna head on the road? Head on the road. Whatever. So, we just left the campground and we are headed to Oswald's Bear Ranch. They have the north, I think the largest collection of black bears, is it? Probably. Largest collection of black bears in the United States. Or at least like on this side of the United States. Cause we were at a black bear ranch one time out west and they had a lot of bears too. I think they had a large collection of bears though, not just black bears. Yeah, I think they had like grizzly bears. Yeah, they had a Kodiak. I remember that. And this guy just has just black bears. So, we're gonna go see some bears. Not you girls. You girls are gonna have to sit in the car with the air conditioner on for a little bit. That's why we have two sets of keys. We're at the bear ranch. There's their dens. And way back there we see a bear. These are the female bears, I believe. There's a big bear right there. Just a walking. They just remind me of dogs. Imagine what it sounds like when they get all playing. Yeah. Probably like Shelby and Oakley. Yeah. Look a bear, panting just like the dogs. We don't have any apples. We didn't buy any apples yet. And don't look like he needs many apples. Pretty cool. What's up dude? What's up? Are you hot? I think these are the females he said. Yeah, and she looks like she could be pregnant. No, they're getting ready for hibernation, Jamie. Oh, that's right. Man, looks like an apple. There's that one sleeping under a tree. There's another one walking down here. I think they said there's seven in this enclosure. They have 29 all together here. Look, another bear. This one just sat down to stare at Rebecca. What do you think, Rebecca? You ever been that close to a bear? No. What are you doing, huh? Just chilling out in there? Just chilling out. She's a little smaller than the last one. Yeah, she is. Oh, look at this one. It reminds me of Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh. Kind of hanging out. Is that comfortable? Sure looks comfortable. Are you a boy? No, that's a girl. Them other ones must have been boys. Look how little she is. She's just a-walking. Looking for food. Here she goes. Looking away. Looking away. She makes a loop. And eyes. Boom. She's looking for an apple. Yeah, she wants to make sure it's not up here. Let's keep walking. We'll go find more. There's lots more. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one here's sitting up. He's like, Oh, but I wanted an apple. Those people are feeding the bears apples. So they're going to follow them all the way around. They're going to try to anyway. Uh-huh. This one's playing in the water. Didn't think he was going to. Look. King of the mountain. Yep, always balancing. He's going to lay right down in the water. Oh, I bet that feels good. That's funny. Both of them are like, Slowly going. How cool is that? So, where are we? The bear pen. Oswald, the bear pen. Bear pen. Oswald's bear ranch. In Newberry. In Newberry. Yep. Got Rebecca.

Yeah, there's a couple ten year old black bears in here. I don't know. Where are we going next? Fayette. Fayette? Way down to Fayette? I don't know. Are we going to stop there first? Probably stop somewhere first. I have no idea. Uh, seen? Wildlife refuge? Maybe. Maybe we'll do that on the way back for that time. Maybe. Anyway. I was just wondering why I brought this camera. So now you can clip this out. Bye. More bears. I think that was the one we just saw swimming. Oh look, he's going to climb the tree. There he goes. You can do it dude. Get it, get it, get it. It's not as little as it used to be. These are juvenile bears. They're playing back there. Want it? There's your little big truck bear. Come on. Yeah, I think he's a little big for up there. There's one big bear. Check him out. He's pretty big. Well, there's a big boy. What's up big boy? There's another big boy back there. Yeah. The claws will kill you. Oh, big yawn. Oh, baby yawn.

Cause I had fun. Did you have fun? I had fun. Did you have fun, Rebecca? Yes, I had fun. And the dogs did well sitting in the car. We didn't leave them for too long. So, on to Newberry, I guess. It was neat to see all the bears playing. Yeah, we got some cool video we'll show you guys. And I guess if you're gonna go, you gotta go early in the morning while they're out moving around. Yeah, cause once it gets hot, they're not... They don't like to be out. Why are you in my face? Put in my face. Jamie's outside putting air in the camper tires and the Jeep tires. We got one dog. We got two dogs. We got all three dogs. There's camper. Can't see it cause the window's really dirty. There's Jamie. He just put air in the tires.

Thanks to the support of many individuals we were able to provide Nikita with a huge enclosure addition so she has much more room to run around, explore and find new sleeping spots :)A huge ROAR of gratitude to these donors for their help making this possible...Lawrence & Pamela TrisselCarolyn & Robert ButlerThe Manny & Ruthy Cohen FoundationTheresa CooperKim DeverBecky GagliardoCoral L.

She was found chained to a wall in a drug house during a law enforcement raid in Tennessee. Because she'd been confined to live on a concrete floor, she had huge swollen masses on her elbows that took months to heal, and was severely underweight. As you can see, she's made a full recovery since being rescued and is now the largest lion we have at the sanctuary, even bigger than our male lions Joseph and Cameron. Because she's such a big girl who just loves to frolic, run around and play, we wanted to provide Nikita with a large addition to her enclosure that she'd be able to explore and enjoy. Big Cat Rescue is situated on 55 acres in Tampa, Florida, and we're home to over 100 rescued exotic cats that were previously unwanted, abandoned or abused. The sanctuary seeks to provide the very best home we can for the cats in our care, and educate the public about the plight of these magnificent animals. The cats' enclosures are created to provide as natural an environment as possible, including trees for our leopards, who love to climb, pools for the tigers, so they can cool off, and even fresh sand for our sand cats to enjoy. So with Nikita in mind, and our goal set in place, we put our Big Cat plan into action. We wanted Nikita's new habitat to include an additional 3,500 square feet. So we needed to build an enclosure addition that measured 50 feet by 70 feet in size, at a cost of approximately $20,000. We put the word out to our supporters, and they definitely roared into action. Big Cat Rescue is fortunate to have supporters around the world who not only enable us to provide for the well-being of the cats, but also that of the sanctuary's fiscal sustainability. Lawrence and Pamela Tristle are two long-time supporters who generously donated half the cost to build Nikita's enclosure expansion as a matching grant, and hundreds of other supporters responded to help meet our goal. The first thing we had to do was make room for the addition, which meant lots of trimming, weeding, root removal, and leveling of the ground. Thanks to volunteers from the U.S. Army Citrus Park Recruiting Station here in Tampa, and of course, Big Cat Rescue volunteers, this was accomplished in record time, while Nikita kept busy watching over all involved. The perimeter of Nikita's new addition was marked out, and construction began. The walls of the enclosure were to be 15 feet in height, with a 5-foot cantilever, making the total height of the enclosure approximately 18 feet. Once all of the posts were in place, over 50 panels were hung, reinforced, cut to size, and then fixed in place. This process took almost three weeks to complete, and I'm sure Nikita was feeling a little sympathetic towards the workers. Then, the big day arrived. The Big Cat transformation was complete. Donors, volunteers, interns, and staff members alike all turned out to see Nikita take her first steps in her new territory. Everything was in place, including Nikita's favorite big yellow boomer ball, as well as a paper mache warthog for her to make friends with. Nikita was definitely ready to explore, while everybody eagerly looked on, and she didn't disappoint. Take a look. Big Cat Rescue would like to thank everyone who made this possible. Nikita may show her appreciation in unique ways, but thanks to our supporters, donors, and volunteers, we've truly enriched the life of this big girl.\nComment: We would LOVE to have you draw cat coloring pages for our website.

Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.

She was found chained to a wall in a drug house during a law enforcement raid in Tennessee. Because she'd been confined to live on a concrete floor, she had huge swollen masses on her elbows that took months to heal, and was severely underweight. As you can see, she's made a full recovery since being rescued and is now the largest lion we have at the sanctuary, even bigger than our male lions Joseph and Cameron. Because she's such a big girl who just loves to frolic, run around and play, we wanted to provide Nikita with a large addition to her enclosure that she'd be able to explore and enjoy. Big Cat Rescue is situated on 55 acres in Tampa, Florida, and we're home to over 100 rescued exotic cats that were previously unwanted, abandoned or abused. The sanctuary seeks to provide the very best home we can for the cats in our care, and educate the public about the plight of these magnificent animals. The cats' enclosures are created to provide as natural an environment as possible, including trees for our leopards, who love to climb, pools for the tigers, so they can cool off, and even fresh sand for our sand cats to enjoy. So with Nikita in mind, and our goal set in place, we put our Big Cat plan into action. We wanted Nikita's new habitat to include an additional 3,500 square feet. So we needed to build an enclosure addition that measured 50 feet by 70 feet in size, at a cost of approximately $20,000. We put the word out to our supporters, and they definitely roared into action. Big Cat Rescue is fortunate to have supporters around the world who not only enable us to provide for the well-being of the cats, but also that of the sanctuary's fiscal sustainability. Lawrence and Pamela Tristle are two long-time supporters who generously donated half the cost to build Nikita's enclosure expansion as a matching grant, and hundreds of other supporters responded to help meet our goal. The first thing we had to do was make room for the addition, which meant lots of trimming, weeding, root removal, and leveling of the ground. Thanks to volunteers from the U.S. Army Citrus Park Recruiting Station here in Tampa, and of course, Big Cat Rescue volunteers, this was accomplished in record time, while Nikita kept busy watching over all involved. The perimeter of Nikita's new addition was marked out, and construction began. The walls of the enclosure were to be 15 feet in height, with a 5-foot cantilever, making the total height of the enclosure approximately 18 feet. Once all of the posts were in place, over 50 panels were hung, reinforced, cut to size, and then fixed in place. This process took almost three weeks to complete, and I'm sure Nikita was feeling a little sympathetic towards the workers. Then, the big day arrived. The Big Cat transformation was complete. Donors, volunteers, interns, and staff members alike all turned out to see Nikita take her first steps in her new territory. Everything was in place, including Nikita's favorite big yellow boomer ball, as well as a paper mache warthog for her to make friends with. Nikita was definitely ready to explore, while everybody eagerly looked on, and she didn't disappoint. Take a look. Big Cat Rescue would like to thank everyone who made this possible. Nikita may show her appreciation in unique ways, but thanks to our supporters, donors, and volunteers, we've truly enriched the life of this big girl.\nComment: Kids can do a lot of things.

They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: @TheRASPUZIO Thanks for watching!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: River Otters vs Alligators 03 Music  Otters are semi-aquatic, slender, long-bodied mammals which are specialized for capturing prey in the water. Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old. River Otters was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro / South Florida 2014.\nTranscript: ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪\nComment: Like from Brasil."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: God I love white tigers but knowing this makes me feel bad for them :("},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

That may mean habitat loss for local animals.  Now, a strip of woods near HSUS headquarters is being developed.   Here's a look at how some animals are surviving.\nTranscript: For the animals living in this patch of woods, home is changing. Really large equipment is going to come and knock these trees down and it's going to be a real upheaval. A property near the headquarters of the Humane Society of the United States will soon be filled with pavement. The road is going to come right through here along this fence line and it's going to go right along these burrow sites. Earth movers are breaking ground, putting many animals, including groundhogs and fox, in harm's way. They wouldn't make it. Fox and groundhogs would likely not make it. The animals would get buried alive, especially since this is ground zero. We know this is where the road is coming through, so we know this area is going to be completely altered. And most of it is going to be gone. So many animals are being relocated. The trapping effort is sort of the last ditch effort to get the remaining animals out of the burrow systems. Take this groundhog brought to a new home miles away. But here she'll be safe. And HSU's staff is stepping in to make sure others survive the habitat loss. I'm fortunate that these animals have been living here for countless years and are going to be losing their homes, so I want to just dedicate a little bit of my time to try to help them and save their lives ultimately. It's sort of, I guess, representative of what's happening across America with increasing development and urban sprawl and so forth. Got him. Got him? Yeah. The more people, the better, because the more ground we can cover, the more intensely we can sweep, and the likelihood, you know, of finding more animals and getting them off the site to save them improves. Destroyed. But it's hard to see them, real hard to see. With some encouragement, many animals did move on their own. Now an entirely new home awaits, and hopefully soon enough, this will feel like home. Hopefully we're doing the best we can, giving as many animals a chance as we can.\nComment: *sigh* atleast you guys rescued some of those animals"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets. A female red fox is known as a vixen, and a male red fox is known as a dog fox; a fox baby is known as a kit or cub.\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: great video. cute family and awesome birdcall."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Hi, Rebecca! There's a camper and the Jeep and that's the lake. That's Muska Lounge Lake. Notice how there's not people on top of people on top of people. I guess, I never showed you guys that at the other campground. Anyway, this is a nice campground. And look, grass, not dirt. The campground that we stayed at last weekend, it was all dirt. Every single campsite was dirt. Which is just crazy. So, we're getting ready to head on the road. Head on the road. We're gonna head on the road? Head on the road. Whatever. So, we just left the campground and we are headed to Oswald's Bear Ranch. They have the north, I think the largest collection of black bears, is it? Probably. Largest collection of black bears in the United States. Or at least like on this side of the United States. Cause we were at a black bear ranch one time out west and they had a lot of bears too. I think they had a large collection of bears though, not just black bears. Yeah, I think they had like grizzly bears. Yeah, they had a Kodiak. I remember that. And this guy just has just black bears. So, we're gonna go see some bears. Not you girls. You girls are gonna have to sit in the car with the air conditioner on for a little bit. That's why we have two sets of keys. We're at the bear ranch. There's their dens. And way back there we see a bear. These are the female bears, I believe. There's a big bear right there. Just a walking. They just remind me of dogs. Imagine what it sounds like when they get all playing. Yeah. Probably like Shelby and Oakley. Yeah. Look a bear, panting just like the dogs. We don't have any apples. We didn't buy any apples yet. And don't look like he needs many apples. Pretty cool. What's up dude? What's up? Are you hot? I think these are the females he said. Yeah, and she looks like she could be pregnant. No, they're getting ready for hibernation, Jamie. Oh, that's right. Man, looks like an apple. There's that one sleeping under a tree. There's another one walking down here. I think they said there's seven in this enclosure. They have 29 all together here. Look, another bear. This one just sat down to stare at Rebecca. What do you think, Rebecca? You ever been that close to a bear? No. What are you doing, huh? Just chilling out in there? Just chilling out. She's a little smaller than the last one. Yeah, she is. Oh, look at this one. It reminds me of Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh. Kind of hanging out. Is that comfortable? Sure looks comfortable. Are you a boy? No, that's a girl. Them other ones must have been boys. Look how little she is. She's just a-walking. Looking for food. Here she goes. Looking away. Looking away. She makes a loop. And eyes. Boom. She's looking for an apple. Yeah, she wants to make sure it's not up here. Let's keep walking. We'll go find more. There's lots more. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one here's sitting up. He's like, Oh, but I wanted an apple. Those people are feeding the bears apples. So they're going to follow them all the way around. They're going to try to anyway. Uh-huh. This one's playing in the water. Didn't think he was going to. Look. King of the mountain. Yep, always balancing. He's going to lay right down in the water. Oh, I bet that feels good. That's funny. Both of them are like, Slowly going. How cool is that? So, where are we? The bear pen. Oswald, the bear pen. Bear pen. Oswald's bear ranch. In Newberry. In Newberry. Yep. Got Rebecca.

Probably stop somewhere first. I have no idea. Uh, seen? Wildlife refuge? Maybe. Maybe we'll do that on the way back for that time. Maybe. Anyway. I was just wondering why I brought this camera. So now you can clip this out. Bye. More bears. I think that was the one we just saw swimming. Oh look, he's going to climb the tree. There he goes. You can do it dude. Get it, get it, get it. It's not as little as it used to be. These are juvenile bears. They're playing back there. Want it? There's your little big truck bear. Come on. Yeah, I think he's a little big for up there.

Cause I had fun. Did you have fun? I had fun. Did you have fun, Rebecca? Yes, I had fun. And the dogs did well sitting in the car. We didn't leave them for too long. So, on to Newberry, I guess. It was neat to see all the bears playing. Yeah, we got some cool video we'll show you guys. And I guess if you're gonna go, you gotta go early in the morning while they're out moving around. Yeah, cause once it gets hot, they're not... They don't like to be out. Why are you in my face? Put in my face. Jamie's outside putting air in the camper tires and the Jeep tires. We got one dog.

The sanctuary is a permanent home to over 100 rescued big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards. As well as smaller species like bobcats, servals, and sand cats. Campers arrive every day and get to explore our 55 acre property, making sure they say hello to the cats and taking lots of photos along the way. While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this. We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life. Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans. They get to do lots of fun activities, like making Big Cat popsicles and learning about our operant conditioning program and why it's so important to the cats at the sanctuary. Then campers observe Big Cat keepers handing out the popsicles they made and the cats willingly participating in our operant conditioning program.

Walking around you can gaze upon some of the more amazing animals from around the world. From some of the largest to the downright deadly. Zoos offer the average Joe, and his family, a glimpse into the wonders of the natural world. The zoo can trace its origins back to a more family unfriendly time, to ancient Egypt, when for the pharaoh, owning a hippo zoo was completely normal. It was only into the 19th century when the roaring industrial masses wanted a piece of the action, and science was taking off that the modern zoo was born. And sure, zoos have received bad press in the past, but the modern zoo has been reinvented as a centre of science and conservation. So what are the roles of a modern zoo? Well, roughly speaking, we can divide them into three categories, education, breeding centres, and research. So let's start with education. It's simple really, zoos are a fun and safe place to learn for both kids and adults. The fact is, the animals are real, and you can get up and close to some of the more exotic and threatened creatures from around the world. Every year, 150 million people visit zoos around the world, and it's so important that the next generation is educated and understands the role they play in preserving our planet. Better still, many zoos have education centres with dedicated teams who aim to teach kids about everything from ecosystem services to climate change. Zoos also play an important role as breeding centres. Most zoos these days are part of organisations set up to coordinate breeding programmes and keep standards high. This means your favourite animal like the chimpanzee here is probably part of some national or even international breeding programme. These help zoos maintain genetic diversity and are extremely important for species that are threatened with extinction in the wild. One example is the scimitar-horned oryx. This is a species that became extinct in the wild and only survived in zoos and private collections. It is now part of several international breeding programmes and the hope is one day it will be reintroduced into the wild. And finally, Zoos offer a unique opportunity for biologists. Instead of spending days trying to track down an animal and becoming exhausted in the process, zoos offer a more controlled environment where effective research can be undertaken. Take the devastating disease chytridiomycosis. This has caused dramatic declines and even extinction in at least 200 species of frog. Zoos are actively taking part in research aiming to stop the spread of this disease. Research in zoos contribute to a number of scientific fields including animal behaviour and endocrinology, all ultimately contributing to the conservation of our biodiversity. So sure, a trip to the zoo is a great family day out, but zoos these days aren't there to show off your new hippo. Zoos are centres for conservation, educating the new generation, giving critically endangered species another chance and helping us gather knowledge for the conservation of species and biodiversity.

You don't see many mammals, far fewer than in African or South American forests. But what this place lacks in mammals, it makes up for in birds. Not that it's all that easy to see them. You know they're around because you can hear them. But if you want to watch them, you have to move fairly quietly. And there is one of the smallest of the whole family. This is the one with those extraordinary sawtooth plumes, the King of Saxony's bird. There's nothing else remotely like these plumes in the whole of the bird world. He's calling for a female. And it's not just his plumes that are unique. So is his way of dancing. This is the King of Saxony, and this is his wife, the Queen of Saxony. That hissing noise is his calling. You can tell he's getting particularly excited because he's erected the black feathers on his shoulders into a cape, another of those transformation tricks that seem to be a speciality of this family. He's so worked up, he's trying to mate with a tuft of moss. A female at last. He's so worked up, he's trying to mate with a tuft of moss. A female at last. Typical female colouring.

This video was taken immediately following the charge and shows the aftermath of the mauling that never happened.\nTranscript: Okay, we're on Montague Island out of Port Chalmers and we're hiking up the mountain. We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around.\nComment: They were deer hunting most people take rubber gloves and a rifle.

YES, the rabbit has cancer, but there is nothing I can do to help him. I have talked to the wildlife rehabilitation centers in my area, DNR, other animal vets, AND have done further research on my own about the disease and there is NOTHING that can be done to save the rabbit.

The hyenas moo to show affection like a cat purrs.  Then they laugh when getting ready to eat.   They are one of the most intelligent and powerful animas in the world.  Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

As the hours pass, I realize something's wrong. Even the band's stallion, Boomer, tries to encourage the foal.

Then Looking Glass approaches. And I was shocked at what happened next. The mares try to stop him. Boomer charges in, but it's too late. I tell myself the stallion did the foal a favor, saving it from a lingering death.

Editor: Lucy Garrick, Graphics: Matt White.\nTranscript: This is our gorgeous white rhino, Kai. Although he may look really big and tough, he's actually as sweet as a puppy dog. Well what Kai does is he's actually got a big mud bath in his enclosure. It's pretty cool. He gets a bit dirty. Sometimes when he has that mud all over him, he loves it if you can just pick it off and scratch. It just kind of feels like a massage. They have that mud on their back to help them as like a sunscreen and a mosquito repellent. They actually can't see really well. But Robert, what can they do? They have really, really good hearing. And what's funny about Kai is if you look just on his ears, he's got those little tufts of fur. Isn't that silly? We're not really sure why he has it. Maybe it's to keep the dust out of his ears. This is the white rhino. And they're different from their cousin, the black rhino, for a few different reasons. Firstly, these guys are grazers. So if you look at their mouth, they have that real rectangular shape and really big squishy lips. That's because they eat things like grass. But if you compare them to their cousin, the black rhino, they have a more triangular shaped mouth, don't they? Yeah. It's really pointy. And do you know why they have that? That's because they eat different foods. It's true. So they eat more like things like shrubs. Yeah, so rhinos can actually grow up to be two tons. They're really, really heavy. It's true. Now, the poor rhinos are in a lot of trouble. They're actually critically endangered because of that gorgeous horn. That horn is made out of keratin, which is the same as our fingernails. What people do is they'll kill the rhinos for that horn to turn it into traditional medicine. The biggest thing to protect rhinos or any wildlife is to never, ever buy wildlife products.

Our mission for this outing was to focus on animals that tend to converge near watering holes; however, on the drive over the first animal we spotted was the ever elusive leopard. It literally walked right out in front of our Land Rover, and our guide Lloyd was even more excited than us. As the day progressed we witnessed plenty of fascinating events at random watering holes. Impalas, wildebeests and buffalo drinking with crocodiles lurking dangerously submerged under the water. In another section Hippos lazily bathing in mud and a monitor lizard slinking across a barren stretch of land. It was another very eventful safari and we ended up spotting all of 'The Big 5' with mere minutes left on tour with an intimate encounter with a Rhino to close things off.

The focus today is going to be to find animals like being around the water. So we're going to be visiting a watering hole maybe seeing some buffalo, some hippos and we'll see what else we can find. So again, it's an early start. It's around five thirty in the morning and we're going to head on out there.So far, so good as far as the weather today. It looks like we're going to have a lot better visibility. We had an amazing sunrise to witness this morning. But it is chilly and so we're all bundled up. It's a lot colder than it was yesterday but the sun is coming out. We actually had a little bit of drizzle yesterday, so it'll be warmer. Just waiting for it to get warmer. And I think we're going to have even better visibility for photos and video in terms of taking shots of the animals. So, exciting stuff!Okay, so a pretty cool morning so far. We managed to spot the ever elusive leopard. So that was pretty cool. And we also saw a heard of elephants that were just crossing the road. There was about fifteen or twenty of them, so that was also a pretty impressive sight.One of the coolest things that I've seen today was at a watering hole. There was a crocodile and it was waiting for an impala to drink. And it was so close to attacking it. Like we almost saw this ridiculous crazy scene.Anyways, the crocodile was unsuccessful and it ended up attacking another crocodile. And we captured a bit of that footage.One safari tip to consider is to dress with all kinds of layers. This morning it was freezing. I had on a fleece, I had on a windbreaker and now by the afternoon I'm peeling down to just this tiny kind of athletic shirt. And you've got thick jogging pants on. Yeah, so I wish I had shorts right now for that.Alright, so we are wrapping up our second day of safari. We're going to be heading to the campgrounds soon and we're going to have our first braai for dinner and apparently that is South African barbecue so it should be tasty.This is part of our Travel in South Africa series.

So far so good as far as the weather today. It looks like we're going to have a lot better visibility. We had an amazing sunrise to witness this morning. But it is chilly and so we're all bundled up. It is a lot colder than it was yesterday but the sun is coming out. We actually had a little bit of drizzle yesterday so it will be warmer. Just waiting for it to get warmer. And I think we're going to have even better visibility for photos and video in terms of taking shots of the animals. So exciting stuff. Okay, so pretty cool morning so far. We managed to spot the ever elusive leopard. So that was pretty cool. And we also saw a herd of elephants that were just crossing the road. There was about fifteen or twenty of them so that was also a pretty impressive sight. One of the coolest things I've seen today was at a watering hole. There was a crocodile and it was waiting for an impala to drink and it was so close to attacking it. Like we almost saw this ridiculously crazy scene. Anyways, the crocodile was unsuccessful and it ended up attacking another crocodile and we captured a bit of that footage. One safari tip to consider is to dress with all kinds of layers. This morning it was freezing. I had on a fleece, I had a windbreaker and now by the afternoon I'm peeling down to just this tiny kind of athletic shirt. And you've got thick jogging pants on. Yeah, so I wish I had swords right now for that. Alright, so we are wrapping up our second day of safari. We're going to be heading to the campground soon and we're going to have our first braai for dinner. And apparently that is a South African barbecue, so it should be tasty.\nComment: Awesome! Kruger Park is one of my favorite places in the world. I absolutely loved going Camping there when I was living in South Africa. It looks like you had an amazing time.

Hi, Rebecca! There's a camper and the Jeep and that's the lake. That's Muska Lounge Lake. Notice how there's not people on top of people on top of people. I guess, I never showed you guys that at the other campground. Anyway, this is a nice campground. And look, grass, not dirt. The campground that we stayed at last weekend, it was all dirt. Every single campsite was dirt. Which is just crazy. So, we're getting ready to head on the road. Head on the road. We're gonna head on the road? Head on the road. Whatever. So, we just left the campground and we are headed to Oswald's Bear Ranch. They have the north, I think the largest collection of black bears, is it? Probably. Largest collection of black bears in the United States. Or at least like on this side of the United States. Cause we were at a black bear ranch one time out west and they had a lot of bears too. I think they had a large collection of bears though, not just black bears. Yeah, I think they had like grizzly bears. Yeah, they had a Kodiak. I remember that. And this guy just has just black bears. So, we're gonna go see some bears. Not you girls. You girls are gonna have to sit in the car with the air conditioner on for a little bit. That's why we have two sets of keys. We're at the bear ranch. There's their dens. And way back there we see a bear. These are the female bears, I believe. There's a big bear right there. Just a walking. They just remind me of dogs. Imagine what it sounds like when they get all playing. Yeah. Probably like Shelby and Oakley. Yeah. Look a bear, panting just like the dogs. We don't have any apples. We didn't buy any apples yet. And don't look like he needs many apples. Pretty cool. What's up dude? What's up? Are you hot? I think these are the females he said. Yeah, and she looks like she could be pregnant. No, they're getting ready for hibernation, Jamie. Oh, that's right. Man, looks like an apple. There's that one sleeping under a tree. There's another one walking down here. I think they said there's seven in this enclosure. They have 29 all together here. Look, another bear. This one just sat down to stare at Rebecca. What do you think, Rebecca? You ever been that close to a bear? No. What are you doing, huh? Just chilling out in there? Just chilling out. She's a little smaller than the last one. Yeah, she is. Oh, look at this one. It reminds me of Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh. Kind of hanging out. Is that comfortable? Sure looks comfortable. Are you a boy? No, that's a girl. Them other ones must have been boys. Look how little she is. She's just a-walking. Looking for food. Here she goes. Looking away. Looking away. She makes a loop. And eyes. Boom. She's looking for an apple. Yeah, she wants to make sure it's not up here. Let's keep walking. We'll go find more. There's lots more. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one here's sitting up. He's like, Oh, but I wanted an apple. Those people are feeding the bears apples. So they're going to follow them all the way around. They're going to try to anyway. Uh-huh. This one's playing in the water. Didn't think he was going to. Look. King of the mountain. Yep, always balancing. He's going to lay right down in the water. Oh, I bet that feels good. That's funny. Both of them are like, Slowly going. How cool is that? So, where are we? The bear pen. Oswald, the bear pen. Bear pen. Oswald's bear ranch. In Newberry. In Newberry. Yep. Got Rebecca. And a big fence. There's bears in there. There's bears in there. I got some on my list down there too. There's big male bears in there somewhere. Yeah, there's a couple ten year old black bears in here. I don't know. Where are we going next? Fayette. Fayette? Way down to Fayette? I don't know. Are we going to stop there first? Probably stop somewhere first. I have no idea. Uh, seen? Wildlife refuge? Maybe. Maybe we'll do that on the way back for that time. Maybe. Anyway. I was just wondering why I brought this camera. So now you can clip this out. Bye. More bears. I think that was the one we just saw swimming. Oh look, he's going to climb the tree. There he goes. You can do it dude. Get it, get it, get it. It's not as little as it used to be. These are juvenile bears. They're playing back there. Want it? There's your little big truck bear. Come on. Yeah, I think he's a little big for up there. There's one big bear. Check him out. He's pretty big. Well, there's a big boy. What's up big boy? There's another big boy back there. Yeah. The claws will kill you. Oh, big yawn. Oh, baby yawn. What's up, huh? Oh, you gotta get up, huh? Gotta move. No, you can stay. No, that one's yawning. I'm tired too. We're leaving. I hit the camera. We're leaving Oswald's Bear Ranch and now we're heading down to Newberry. That was pretty cool. If you're ever up here and you're thinking about whether or not you should stop, you should stop. Cause I had fun. Did you have fun? I had fun. Did you have fun, Rebecca? Yes, I had fun. And the dogs did well sitting in the car. We didn't leave them for too long. So, on to Newberry, I guess. It was neat to see all the bears playing. Yeah, we got some cool video we'll show you guys. And I guess if you're gonna go, you gotta go early in the morning while they're out moving around. Yeah, cause once it gets hot, they're not... They don't like to be out. Why are you in my face? Put in my face. Jamie's outside putting air in the camper tires and the Jeep tires. We got one dog. We got two dogs. We got all three dogs. There's camper. Can't see it cause the window's really dirty. There's Jamie. He just put air in the tires.

Here, plants can't get water not because it's frozen, but because rain hardly ever falls, only about one or two inches in the whole year. Most of the time, it's bone dry and devastatingly hot. Yet, almost unbelievably, there are trees standing out in the sands, totally unsheltered, with no sign of moisture anywhere around them. Water storage is the great trick here. These green succulent leaves are full of it, and so are these bloated branches. The local bushmen used to cut off these branches and hollow out the spongy tissue and use them as containers for their arrows, which is why this tree is called the quiver tree. Its branches are covered with a blindingly white powder which reflects the heat, and its leaves have thick rinds with very few pores, which minimizes the amount of water they lose through evaporation. The trunk, even of an old tree ravaged by the years, remains smooth and impermeable, but even the quiver tree can't seal itself off totally from its surroundings. Living involves breathing, and some water vapour is inevitably lost in that process. But this tree has a way of reducing that. Self-amputation. It can cut off a leaf rosette and seal the stump. This branch will never grow leaves again, but with luck, the tree will just survive with a reduced number of leaves and put out new shoots when conditions improve.\nComment: is a honey badger a tree?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The 800,000-acre Twin Peaks Herd Management Area lies along the California-Nevada border northeast of Susanville.\nTranscript: Hi, I'm standing in the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area in Northern California. This is the largest wild horse and burrow management area in BLM California. This summer we're planning a gather to bring in excess horses and burrows because we have too many on the range right now and it's not healthy for either the horses, the burrows or the range that they live on. We manage for a lot of uses out here. Horses and burrows are one of them, as well as cattle and public recreation. So it's important to make sure that we balance all of these uses and make sure that we're taking care of the land we're charged to manage. Today we're going to take you around and show you some of the herd management area. We'll show you some of the areas where the horses and the burrows like to live, where they range, what they eat. We might even be able to see horses and burrows today, that's our plan. Straddling the Nevada-California border about 120 miles north of Reno, Nevada, this rugged high desert landscape provides important habitat for wild horses and burrows and wildlife. It also provides forage for domestic livestock grazing that is an important part of local economies. The appropriate management level for the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area is 448 to 758 wild horses and 72 to 116 wild burrows. The current populations are estimated at 2,300 wild horses, about five times the appropriate management level, and 280 wild burrows, about two times the appropriate management level. At almost 800,000 acres, the region is vast, but its resources limited. In fact, many parts of this rugged-looking landscape are fragile and require careful management. We're standing here on the edge of the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area. I wanted to show you the perennial grasses that are out here and explain a little bit as to why they're important. So before me is some crested wheatgrass and you'll see that it's critical. It's good forage for wild horses and burrows. It also serves as thermal cover for a lot of the smaller species that we have, birds and lizards and things like that. It serves also a purpose of keeping the soil in place. It helps to bind the soil particles together through the root system and also shield the soil particles from raindrop impact. In this part of the HMA, things are higher in elevation, so we end up with more production. These perennial grasses that you see behind me are plentiful and can provide more forage per acre, whereas other parts of the HMA are lower elevation and you end up with approximately 30 acres per one horse a month. We'll show you that a little later when we get to one of those spots. So here we are in the lower elevation area of the Twin Peaks HMA, and while it certainly is beautiful, looks can be deceiving. This area here would take about 30 football fields, or 30 acres, to support one horse per month. It comes out to be a lot of country when you consider we want about 500 horses in the HMA. There are other uses out here as well, such as pronghorn, mule deer, and permitted livestock grazing. The horses and burros are healthy, and much of the range appears to be healthy as well. A closer look, however, reveals that some areas are showing signs of stress, requiring management actions, including reducing the wild horse herd. Limited water and the need to keep water sources healthy are the primary management concerns in Twin Peaks. So we're at Painter Creek now, and this is an area that we would call functioning at risk during our riparian assessments. Some of the indicators here as to why things are not properly functioning. You can see the slough banks here. This is due to trampling from livestock and horses when they come down in. If the right type of riparian vegetation isn't here, and the root system isn't stable enough to hold the soil in place, you'll actually get it sloughing off, destabilizing the banks, and then also causing a decrease in water quality. So there are several reasons why we want to keep riparian areas from becoming this degraded, and why we want to see them in proper functioning condition and not functioning at risk. That includes for the health of the wildlife that use the area, as well as the health of the Twin Peaks horse herd. It's important to keep this water system available and functioning year-round, since water is such a limiting factor in these arid environments. So this is an example of a properly functioning riparian area. Some of the indicators that you would look for would be riparian species covering the banks, which is what you see here, aquatic vegetation throughout the stream channel, clear water that can support wildlife, such as the fish and the minnows that you see in the creek behind us, as well as stabilized makes. Visited during spring, much of the Twin Peaks area appears vibrant and green, but this situation changes over the course of the summer. Hot weather and the lack of rain reduce the amount of forage available for range animals, including wild horses and burros. To keep ranges healthy, the BLM must balance uses at sustainable levels. Livestock are managed in specific areas and allowed on the range for designated grazing seasons. In response to resource conditions, the BLM and ranchers have reduced livestock numbers by about 50% compared to 30 years ago. Wild horses and burros use the range all year, therefore, herd populations must be maintained at sustainable levels. Balancing uses is part of the BLM's multiple-use mandate and responsibility on the public lands. Wild horses are an integral part and an important part of that diversity that's found out on the ranges. However, if their numbers are allowed to increase without management, then eventually it will come to damage not only the resources and the other uses on the ranges, but the wild horses themselves. Twin Peaks has always had the ability to carry some horses. When numbers get very, very high, you can really run into problems. What in effect happens is that more animals end up being at risk and there can be a set up for catastrophic losses, either from a long-term drought or heavy snow. You know, we're proud of the fact that we have healthy wild horses and burros on the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area. It's important to us to be proactive and make sure that we keep the horses and burros within an appropriate management level. Therefore, we come out and every few years we have to remove the excess horses and burros, and that helps us ensure that the horses and burros remain healthy, as well as the rangelands that they like to roam on. The wild horses and burros that we remove off the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area all go to good homes. Some of them are adopted out, they're very popular for their size and their health, and some of them go to long-term pastures. It's important to BLM that these wild horses and burros do end up in good homes or in the long-term pastures where they can spend the rest of their lives. As public land managers, our job is to manage wild horses and burros on the range, to keep both the horses and burros healthy, as well as the rangelands. And we welcome and encourage your involvement in that work. It takes all of us together to make sure that we're doing the right thing by the horses and the burros and the land.\nComment: @conwayhorselover umm what is wrong with us people. cattle are more important than wiled horses"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: the Human is the worst of all Beasts -_-"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: I remember my first learning about White Tigers a year or two back, it was art of a white tiger, listing the medical problems they have & ending with 'but at least I'm beautiful'. It chocked me up and since then I've kept a promise to help share the truth about them, and to tell people not to support zoos or facilites that purposely breed white tigers.

He's moved up the rankings now, he's probably the highest ranking male and he has a lovely personality. Normally a hyena wouldn't let you get this close while it's chomping on something, in this case a gopro, but he's a really fantastic chap. Monty, he's aged around, what are you, about 4 or 5 years old, so he's still a youngster and he's just incredible, he's almost like a human trapped in a plastic bag. This is Woody, and Woody is the second highest ranking male behind the gopro, which is the one chomping over there, and he won't give me the gopro back. Gina is the matriarch and is a gorgeous girl, she's allowed me around her cubs in the past, she's an extremely good mother, protective, and she's quite a loving matriarch in the way that she rules this clan. It's not like most hyenas with an eye on the first, she's actually quite well liked. Having said that, lately the oldest male in this clan has been taking quite a beating, his name's Shanzee, I'll try and go and see him just now, and the youngest hyena who won't come too close is Ringo, and that's because Ringo is wild raised by mum, and when I say wild raised he hasn't had any human influence. Say hello, say hello, say hello, say hello, say hello, say hello, say hello, say hello. What do you want Monty? Are you trying to get in here? I'm trying to get in on the action always.

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: I see a lot of people feel some amount of shame for the poaching that goes on in their respective countries.  I feel that because it is the same for me.  \nIf you feel that way then please think, what can I do to reverse this?  The damage is great but that does not mean that we have to watch our world die one species at a time.  \nThere comes a time when we must choose between what is right and what is easy.\nBeing involved doesn't have to be a big thing, sometimes whats needed is widespread knowledge of an issue and a lot of constant contribution.  \nEveryone has different skills that can be brought to making a change.  At least for me, life is more fun when I try to make things for a better world."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Wolves delisted Again 3/06/2009 URGENT Photos courtesy of  those of you who are unaware of this, the new Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar has delisted the wolves in Western Great Lakes and the Rocky Mountain states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Utah as of March 6th, 2009.  Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5. Mention any of the information that I wrote about above or anything I may have forgotten.Remember, please be polite but state your case.  This is the only chance we have and time is ticking away.  Please share this video with all of your animal loving friends and MAKE THAT CALL ASAP.Is this the change that the majority of Americans voted for in November?\nTranscript: you you you you you you you you you you\nComment: @airsoftmarxman 5 people in Idaho have now been confirmed with life threatening diseases that were brought by wolves, we have had over a dozen wolf/human confrontations in just the last year alone.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: Thank you for your brave service Mandy!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This is Wendy the Guide Girl, also known as Hawk Hunter Diva if you're watching YouTube. I'm sitting in my own back pasture instead of down at the leaves, shopping for some venison. I haven't seen anything I wanted to fling an arrow at yet. I'm in the antler hunting mode. So I got some new stuff from Buzzy. It's called Bowhunter Setup Scrape Juice. So I'm going to test that out today and see if I can't bring in something new. I see something just jumped the fence and I haven't seen it before. So let's check it out and see if he's a shooter. Well, good evening. Welcome to Butch and Wendy's Hunting Adventures. Hawk Hunter Diva decided to go try to get some venison. So we're here in the Hill Country, Texas. The deer are a little smaller up here compared to South Texas or up north, but we have a whole lot of them. I've been sitting in a pop-up blind watching a stream of does and little bucks and stuff. And I was actually after this eight point buck. He was nice and mature, but he didn't come in this morning. And while I was sitting there, this little ten point came in. Well, for the Hill Country, he's a nice little deer. And I decided to go ahead and take him. I had a good hunt. It was nice. And another deal was, the wind wasn't quite blowing right. It's kind of switching around because we have a front coming in. Right now it's 76 degrees here in Central Texas, but tomorrow it's going to be 35 degrees. So actually I was even hunting in shorts this evening. But anyway, the wind was swirling. The deer kept coming in. They were a little spooky. So I'll tell you what I did. I got this Muzzy's Bowhunter set up, the scrape juice, and I sprayed a little bit out the window. And he came in shortly afterwards, but I'll tell you what, don't spray it inside the blind. It smells pretty rough, but I bet deer really like it because I had never seen this buck before out of all the deer I've been watching for the past couple of weeks. And it brought him in, so I guess it works. But have a good evening. Muzzy Phantom did the job, shot him with a crossbow. Central Hill Country of Texas, and it's October 27th, 2010. Y'all have a good evening. We're going to try to go get some more venison here this season, but I guess I'm going to have to change clothes and get something warm. See y'all next time.

This was filmed on one amazing day in Three Sisters Springs, Crystal River, Florida. The music is by my good friends Human Agency ( currently blowing up the Denver music scene.This day was a dream, this trip was serendipitous...every step fell into place like clockwork.Despite manatees not being commonly seen in the area for months, the one day I show up to Crystal River so do the sea cows. I saw huge males, tiny babies, and playful teenage manatees all in Three Sisters Springs at the same time. I also interacted with the fauna of the ecosystem, including snappers, bluegills, and cormorants, who were busy hunting fish. This experience stands out as one of my favorite wildlife encounters to date. The manatees are so friendly, and genuinely seem to appreciate your company. They eagerly seek out belly-rubs and scratches in the same way my dog does. It was so much fun hanging out with them. Unfortunately, I also saw scars on the backs of nearly every manatee in the springs. The animals get hurt or killed from run-ins with boats in the Florida waterways. Only 5,000 or so of these amazing animals remain in the wild. This was filmed with GoPro Hero2 and Hero3 cameras, filmed at either 1080p or 2.7k, 30fps, using the ProTune setting.

Hi, Rebecca! There's a camper and the Jeep and that's the lake. That's Muska Lounge Lake. Notice how there's not people on top of people on top of people. I guess, I never showed you guys that at the other campground. Anyway, this is a nice campground. And look, grass, not dirt. The campground that we stayed at last weekend, it was all dirt. Every single campsite was dirt. Which is just crazy. So, we're getting ready to head on the road. Head on the road. We're gonna head on the road? Head on the road. Whatever. So, we just left the campground and we are headed to Oswald's Bear Ranch. They have the north, I think the largest collection of black bears, is it? Probably. Largest collection of black bears in the United States. Or at least like on this side of the United States. Cause we were at a black bear ranch one time out west and they had a lot of bears too. I think they had a large collection of bears though, not just black bears. Yeah, I think they had like grizzly bears. Yeah, they had a Kodiak. I remember that. And this guy just has just black bears. So, we're gonna go see some bears. Not you girls. You girls are gonna have to sit in the car with the air conditioner on for a little bit. That's why we have two sets of keys. We're at the bear ranch. There's their dens. And way back there we see a bear. These are the female bears, I believe. There's a big bear right there. Just a walking. They just remind me of dogs. Imagine what it sounds like when they get all playing. Yeah. Probably like Shelby and Oakley. Yeah. Look a bear, panting just like the dogs. We don't have any apples. We didn't buy any apples yet. And don't look like he needs many apples. Pretty cool. What's up dude? What's up? Are you hot? I think these are the females he said. Yeah, and she looks like she could be pregnant. No, they're getting ready for hibernation, Jamie. Oh, that's right. Man, looks like an apple. There's that one sleeping under a tree. There's another one walking down here. I think they said there's seven in this enclosure. They have 29 all together here. Look, another bear. This one just sat down to stare at Rebecca. What do you think, Rebecca? You ever been that close to a bear? No. What are you doing, huh? Just chilling out in there? Just chilling out. She's a little smaller than the last one. Yeah, she is. Oh, look at this one. It reminds me of Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh. Kind of hanging out. Is that comfortable? Sure looks comfortable. Are you a boy? No, that's a girl. Them other ones must have been boys. Look how little she is. She's just a-walking. Looking for food. Here she goes. Looking away. Looking away. She makes a loop. And eyes. Boom. She's looking for an apple. Yeah, she wants to make sure it's not up here. Let's keep walking. We'll go find more. There's lots more. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one here's sitting up. He's like, Oh, but I wanted an apple. Those people are feeding the bears apples. So they're going to follow them all the way around. They're going to try to anyway. Uh-huh. This one's playing in the water. Didn't think he was going to. Look. King of the mountain. Yep, always balancing. He's going to lay right down in the water. Oh, I bet that feels good. That's funny. Both of them are like, Slowly going. How cool is that? So, where are we? The bear pen. Oswald, the bear pen. Bear pen. Oswald's bear ranch. In Newberry. In Newberry. Yep. Got Rebecca.

Yeah, there's a couple ten year old black bears in here. I don't know. Where are we going next? Fayette. Fayette? Way down to Fayette? I don't know. Are we going to stop there first? Probably stop somewhere first. I have no idea. Uh, seen? Wildlife refuge? Maybe. Maybe we'll do that on the way back for that time. Maybe. Anyway. I was just wondering why I brought this camera. So now you can clip this out. Bye. More bears. I think that was the one we just saw swimming. Oh look, he's going to climb the tree. There he goes. You can do it dude. Get it, get it, get it. It's not as little as it used to be. These are juvenile bears. They're playing back there. Want it? There's your little big truck bear. Come on. Yeah, I think he's a little big for up there. There's one big bear. Check him out. He's pretty big. Well, there's a big boy. What's up big boy? There's another big boy back there. Yeah. The claws will kill you. Oh, big yawn. Oh, baby yawn.

Cause I had fun. Did you have fun? I had fun. Did you have fun, Rebecca? Yes, I had fun. And the dogs did well sitting in the car. We didn't leave them for too long. So, on to Newberry, I guess. It was neat to see all the bears playing. Yeah, we got some cool video we'll show you guys. And I guess if you're gonna go, you gotta go early in the morning while they're out moving around. Yeah, cause once it gets hot, they're not... They don't like to be out. Why are you in my face? Put in my face. Jamie's outside putting air in the camper tires and the Jeep tires. We got one dog. We got two dogs. We got all three dogs. There's camper. Can't see it cause the window's really dirty. There's Jamie. He just put air in the tires.

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: CANADIAN LYNX - Species Spotlight Dances With Wolves is the resident Canadian Lynx at Big Cat Rescue. Listen to Master Keeper Barbara Frank talk about Dances and Canadian Lynx in the wild.Image of Canadian Lynx in trap courtesy of:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: This is Dances with Wolves, Big Cat Rescue's resident Canadian lynx. She's also one of the oldest cats at the sanctuary. She'll be turning 19 in July. The name lynx comes from the Greek word to shine, which is probably in reference to the reflective ability of the cat's eyes. The Canadian lynx looks very similar to its cousin, the Siberian lynx. Their dense fur ranges in color from a reddish brown to gray. They have a flared facial ruff, black ear tufts, and long hind legs with a short tail. Their large, widespread feet are covered in fur, which act as snowshoes and are effective in supporting the cat's weight on the snow. They are often confused with their smaller feline cousin, the bobcat, but can be easily distinguished by their tail tips. The tail of the lynx looks as though it was dipped in an inkwell, being black all the way around, whereas the bobcat's tail appears to have been painted black on top and white on the bottom. They are larger on average than the bobcat, yet vary less in size, so the largest bobcats can outsize the lynx. Canadian lynx are found in the northern forests across almost all of Canada and Alaska, as well as in certain parts of North America. They're a secretive and mostly nocturnal animal, although they may be active at any time of the day. Unlike any other species of cat, the lynx depends almost exclusively on the snowshoe hare. No other predator has such a strong cyclic prey base to which it has become uniquely adapted. The snowshoe hare population peaks every 10 years, and with it, so does the lynx population. While lynx will change their prey base when hares are low to include rodents, birds, larger prey such as deer, the overall lynx population is still synchronous with the hare population. The greatest threat to the Canadian lynx is being trapped for their fur, and when this is done during low numbers, it makes recovery of the population extremely difficult. And of course, just like all the other wild species of cats, destruction of their habitat by humans is also a big concern. Dances with Wolves was rescued from a game farm. Game farms are places where exotic animals are bred for photography and filming. These animals are often drugged and chained in place and surrounded by props that resemble their natural habitat. These are many of the photos that you see on calendars and in commercials. To find out more, visit our website, bigcatrescue.org. You can help us change the way people treat big cats by texting the word TIGER to 20222.\nComment: @nadjahlover When we first started rescuing animals we did buy them out of certain situations to save them, however we soon realized that this was simply fueling the trade, the owners could then go out and buy another big cat and we could not afford to buy every cat we saw out of a bad situation unfortunately. We quit breeding in the 90's, we would rather put our resources towards rescuing more cats than breeding more to live in cages for their entire life."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It's Great value, well camouflaged, well made, easy to put up and take down, not like the fold away dome hides at all. It's all waterproof and I was using it today in the pouring rain and didn't get wet at all ( though you will if u have the zip part of the windows down as rain gets through the mesh). All in all a very happy purchase, just hope I get some good use from it.\nTranscript: Hello, this is my review of the One Man Photography Chairhide. As you can see it's nice and camouflaged. The one-way lining is velcro strapped. So you can tear that down and have a nice little opening to point your camera out. The front zips down, so you have a nice wide opening if you want a better view. Have a look in the air for any birds of prey. But today I've been using it zipped up like this and it's worked really well. The birds can't see me at all. I've got some nice photographs of some starlings on there and a robin as well. The chairhide's got plenty of room inside. It can be pegged down, comes with a nice carry bag. The backpack fits on your back. It weighs about 5kg, which is quite heavy. But with the backpack sticking on your back it shouldn't be too bad. There's a few windows here. One there, one there. Same on the other side. We've got one-way viewing mesh, so you can see out but they can't see in. And you can velcro them down as well, so you can have the thing completely open if you like. There's also these little covers. They just zip down like that, let you see out. Well, it's one-way but from a distance. If you want to get in, just lift the front up. It's a bit of a faff one-handed, but... Alright, maybe quite a faff one-handed. There you go, you can go the same side. It is a lot easier when you've got two hands to use. It's a nice comfy chair, about the same as you get in a camp stove. Cup holder. Nice inside, easy to put up, easy to take down. Only take you a couple of minutes to put it away. Loads of room inside, you can fit your tripod in. And a camera bag as well. Really nice chair hide, this one's the Stealth Gear one. From Morris Photography for about £75. Really great value. Apart from the weight, which makes it a bit awkward to take with you everywhere you go. But if you set somewhere up, feed a station, it should work a treat. You get some great photos, birds don't even know you're there.\nComment: @OrpheusonRS I think until to try wearing a lumpy backpack that weighs 5KG's and contains this chair hide you'll realise it does feel quite heavy. Thing is the camera gear also weighs a few more KG's and it all adds up. Due to my transport limitations and location limitations I've not bothered using the chair hide and since aquired a a stealthwildlife bag hide. It weighs much less as it's just mesh material all be it quite heavy duty and is much easier to carry around over the shoulder. "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5. Mention any of the information that I wrote about above or anything I may have forgotten.Remember, please be polite but state your case.  This is the only chance we have and time is ticking away.  Please share this video with all of your animal loving friends and MAKE THAT CALL ASAP.Is this the change that the majority of Americans voted for in November?\nTranscript: you you you you you you you you you you\nComment: I heard that they had been delisted.

Today Simon, the Founder of Wildlife Aid Foundation, was called out to rescue an adult Fox that was tangled up in a shed somewhere in Epsom.To his amazement, the lady opened the door to a very embarrassed looking fox who had come a cropper on a lawn mower's power cable!Simon struggled to understand just how the poor Fox could get so entangled in such a small piece of exposed cable. He did his best to restore the Fox's dignity and freedom, however the constriction on his leg was too bad and required treatment back at the wildlife hospital.As it's St George's Day we have decided to called the Fox St George (only for online referencing), however we can't see him slaying any Dragon's anytime soon!You can follow St George's progress on our Facebook page: www.facebook.com/wildlifeaidAbout TheWildlifeAidTVEver wanted to see the goings on behind the scenes at a Wildlife Rescue Centre? Well now you can! We have super cute hedgehogs eating their dinner, dramatic rescues of wild deer and everything in between.\nTranscript: Well, we've got a fox trapped in a shed and apparently he's trapped in some wire in the shed, so I'm not quite sure what kit we're going to need. Hello, do you have a fox trapped in a shed? Yes, it's a one hind leg, very tight. Is it? Yeah, he got so frightened up there. Well, I can see the injuries. He looks very tightly constricted by one of his legs. It looks incredibly tight. I don't really, he's mangy as well, which is a slight worry. What I want to try and do is grasp him so when I finish he can't leg it at great speed. All right, foxy dogs. How he's got stuck around that is absurd. I'm trying to get the fox out without damaging the lady's lawnmower, which is going to be quite interesting. I'm afraid he's already bitten through the mains cable by himself. There's nothing I can do about that. That was not me, I'm innocent. If I can get this handle off the lawnmower, that might give me a bit of slack to play with. Okay, now, I'm getting somewhere. That's it, now the pressure's off. All right, fella. You could have done this if you tried. Okay, he doesn't know it yet, but he's out. So before he knows he's out, I just need to get him grasped so he can't escape, which I've now done. Now I can move that out of the way. I can put the lady's lawnmower back together in a minute, but it has made the leg swollen, and because he's got mange anyway, he'll have to come back into the centre, and we'll see how much damage it's done to the leg. If it's been shut for too long, then obviously there's going to be a constriction problem. You tell them what one pot's contained without me being bitten. That's a bonus. Do they know how long he was stuck? Probably not more than overnight. I'm hoping there's not going to be a serious constriction. Toes are nice and warm. Yeah. Still very swollen. So what I'm probably going to do is shave that bit, so that we can really keep an eye on it. I'm not going to clip it right to the skin, just so that we can see what we're looking at, because sometimes these injuries take a few days to really show themselves. Having clipped it, you can really see how red it is. If this tissue dies here, then there's nothing you can do to stop it. So what we don't want to see is that going sort of black and hard tomorrow. I'm just going to put some of this lovely gel on it today. Just to keep it moist while the skin is hopefully healing. You can see the mange all around this area. It's really common to see it on the rumps of foxes. They quite often get sore patches over the bony hips as well. His heart's really slow. Wheezy as well. Well, he's having antibiotics anyway, for any secondary skin infections that they have from the mange, which is also going to help with his chesty breathing there. And then this is the treatment for the mange. They have to have this every week for three weeks. And then the final treatment will be a spot-on treatment before he goes free. Hopefully, if that leg's OK, we might only have to keep him a couple of weeks. Well, we've done all we can for now. He'll be with us two weeks. He'll be very lucky, probably three weeks, but he should go out in a lot better state than he is now. It's just a matter for the next 72 hours of keeping an eye on that wound, because that is absolutely critical. It's a tinny little house. How do you like it? The one in the corner's just non-stop stuffed his face since he got here. Like, oh, yeah, Liz's face is wicked. Ow! Ow!\nComment: God bless you all"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: seen this video 2 days ago, can get the last track played out of my head.\ncan someone please name the song for me.. i need help.\n* great video btw :), enjoyed it and the ending is really touchy, as a human i feel ashamed of our action. gg vox.\n+ the narrator's voice is smooooooth *_* ..."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: @babylikesumsuga09 AND they really do disappear!  It's amazing.  You'd think with all that orange, they'd stick out like a stop sign, but when I visited Shambala Preserve in September, you could not see the tigers in the shade!

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Video Evidence of Taxpayer Dollars Wasted on Everglades Bridging & Water Pollution Killing Wildlife The news stations and public have been misinformed about the water flowing south through the new 81 to 100 million dollar one mile bridge. The fact is that not a drop has been let through as of yet; the water is too polluted according to National Park regulations to run it south through the National Park. The question is if the water is flowed south will it be able to flow through the National Park the majority of the year? Now a 2.6 mile bridge is in sight, and additional 2.9 miles of bridging to proceed it. The problem we see is that the first 1 mile bridge has not yet been tested. The truth to the whole matter is, the Everglades biggest problem lies up north with pollution that should be corrected before spending taxpayers money on a science project that will be a permeant costly disaster if it does not work.We have studied the water flow patterns through the existing culverts for many decades. We have seen how the wildlife has been affected and have analyzed the situation as a whole. The ecosystem and wildlife is disappearing and suffering. Wildlife is becoming smaller in size, becoming weaker, and natural life spans are getting shorter. In 1998 a florida panther was found dead in Everglades Shark River Slough with levels of mercury so high it could kill an adult human.Right now and for the past several months before the 81 to 100 million dollar bridge was even finished water has actually been flowing through the National Park from south to north through the existing culverts; yes, backwards because the water is too polluted. Everyday a test by one of us has been conducted on the bridge to test the direction of the water flow. A hand full of sand is dropped at the opening, but it sinks straight to the bottom. If the flow of water was flowing south the sand would visibly be carried in that direction. Imagine 2.6 miles of water flowing backwards, (yes north) verses the culverts that are in place now. That equals a lot more water traveling north because water pollution regulations do not permit them to flow south through the National Park. Also sending water south would require permission from the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, which owns lands south of Lake Okeechobee and north of Everglades National Park. The Miccosukee Tribe is against the polluted waters being flowed into their land, and they are taking action to preserve their way of life. They would not be able to survive if the water and food is all poisoned. According to Earth Justice the pumps for polluted water on average contribute the equivalent of 60,000 one hundred pound bag of phosphorus to Lake Okeechobee each year.If the bridging is in place unnatural water depths will follow unnatural hydro-periods and water flow patterns. Now all the wildlife's hammocks will be under water, and there will be no dry land. This will result in unhealthy conditions. More water, more water, more water, is not the answer; Clean water, clean water, clean water, is the answer! Because of being in a hurry to build all these bridges that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars are we really going to sacrifice one environment to stop salt water intrusion down south into the bay? Remember there's only one Everglades and its all connected. All these bridges do not save the Everglades, they flood and pollute them more then they already are. We are affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. We have to treat the source of infection instead of covering it up with a bandaid.\nTranscript: Here we are west of the 2.6 mile bridge proposed area at the S333 lock. Water is not flowing into the Tamiami Trail Canal, the lock is closed. Here we are south of that lock. The water is traveling from the west to the east in the canal south of Tamiami Trail. These overflow pipes were located in this area and removed. When water levels would reach the height of the top of the pipe would flow into the pipe. They would act as an overflow and then flow water south into the canal, flowing the water into the National Park. The water now is flowing at a much more rapid rate into the National Park. The problem is it is making a U-turn and finding the path of least resistance due to sawgrass and a southern ridge. It is making a U-turn and flowing north instead of south. The opposite of what it is supposed to do. As the water flows north it travels through these pipes, culverts that flow into the Tamiami Trail Canal. This area is the center of the 2.6 mile proposed bridge. A bridge located here instead of the culverts would flow way more water north, completely drying out the south. You can see the rapid flow rate with three culverts. Imagine a bridge drying out and creating an unnatural drought south of the Tamiami Trail, interrupting the natural process of this part of the Everglades. Wildlife would suffer. Wildlife has already suffered enough due to over 25 years of held water in these areas and too much water and now more water is proposed, over 2 feet more in the canal. As of right now the National Park does not flow water south due to over 10 parts per billion of water pollution regulations. They have not been able to flow water south even through the one mile bridge. Here you can see water rapidly flowing north through these culverts, the area and center of this 2.6 mile bridge. This is not where the bridge should be located. During droughts this area has always flowed water north. Instead of here, the S3334 locks, when opened, create a suction that even increases drastically the water flow north from the south side, drying up the area even faster. Look at the flow going north into the Tamiami Trail Canal. The Everglades does not travel north, should not travel north. Man has interrupted water flows all over the entire Everglades and we are going to do it again with an irreversible situation and billions of taxpayer dollars. This is where the 2.6 mile bridge would be located. The locks at 3333 are closed. The water is traveling south down the L67 Canal making a U-turn and going back north you can see here on the map. The Blue Shanty, the new river, allowing large amounts of water flow north. This is the S3334 lock area. It is also closed. When opened and water flows south, this creates that suction, vacuum, dropping the water sometimes overnight or days, 6 to 8 inches. Unnatural, completely, not allowing the wildlife to adapt. This is not what is supposed to happen with the bridging. The bridging has to be thought about. The 1 mile bridge has not flowed a drop of water south ever since finished. The public has completely been misinformed. Taxpayer dollars are not at work. The 100 million dollar bridge has not worked. We have stopped and checked this area 3 to 4 times a week with a simple test. Water is not flowing in any direction and has not. When the lock is opened at the S333, it will flow south but sawgrass will clog the area restricting lots of flow. And again, taxpayer dollars will not be well spent. And right now, we must at least test the 1 mile bridge before creating more bad decisions. Another 2.6 mile bridge and maybe even more bridging. Bridge is not working right now. It has not for many, many months. The only way to make this water flow south is to create an unnatural level in the canal which will flow and flood the area, being detrimental and terrible for wildlife, especially mammal life. Heavy pollution coming from the north will kill aquatic life, affecting the food chain. This is not the Everglades restoration. This is the Everglades destruction.\nComment: I attended a meeting by the State of Florida,  AECOM and yes I wrote an article on this Please email me and I can send you the link.  "},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

You don't see many mammals, far fewer than in African or South American forests. But what this place lacks in mammals, it makes up for in birds. Not that it's all that easy to see them. You know they're around because you can hear them. But if you want to watch them, you have to move fairly quietly. And there is one of the smallest of the whole family.

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: This is impressive and awesome.

Let's go find it. We shot this buck late in the evening, and we lost light. So I called Mike and helped him come out here and follow the blood trail. That's where we're at now. We're not too far away. We had a good frost last night, so it was able to freeze a lot of the blood on the leaves and in the soybean field. We've been able to track it very easily up until it got into this thick cover. I think we're pretty close. It's starting to clot up. We're finding it about every 10 yards, finding spots of blood, so it should be real close. Let's head down this way. Still on it here. I don't want to have to work along this bank. He's in the water.

I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: Please go to Big Cat Rescue. org and look under the navigation menu item \"Big Cat Photos and Facts\" to learn more about this."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

Walking around you can gaze upon some of the more amazing animals from around the world. From some of the largest to the downright deadly. Zoos offer the average Joe, and his family, a glimpse into the wonders of the natural world. The zoo can trace its origins back to a more family unfriendly time, to ancient Egypt, when for the pharaoh, owning a hippo zoo was completely normal. It was only into the 19th century when the roaring industrial masses wanted a piece of the action, and science was taking off that the modern zoo was born. And sure, zoos have received bad press in the past, but the modern zoo has been reinvented as a centre of science and conservation. So what are the roles of a modern zoo? Well, roughly speaking, we can divide them into three categories, education, breeding centres, and research. So let's start with education. It's simple really, zoos are a fun and safe place to learn for both kids and adults. The fact is, the animals are real, and you can get up and close to some of the more exotic and threatened creatures from around the world. Every year, 150 million people visit zoos around the world, and it's so important that the next generation is educated and understands the role they play in preserving our planet. Better still, many zoos have education centres with dedicated teams who aim to teach kids about everything from ecosystem services to climate change. Zoos also play an important role as breeding centres. Most zoos these days are part of organisations set up to coordinate breeding programmes and keep standards high. This means your favourite animal like the chimpanzee here is probably part of some national or even international breeding programme. These help zoos maintain genetic diversity and are extremely important for species that are threatened with extinction in the wild. One example is the scimitar-horned oryx. This is a species that became extinct in the wild and only survived in zoos and private collections. It is now part of several international breeding programmes and the hope is one day it will be reintroduced into the wild. And finally, Zoos offer a unique opportunity for biologists. Instead of spending days trying to track down an animal and becoming exhausted in the process, zoos offer a more controlled environment where effective research can be undertaken. Take the devastating disease chytridiomycosis. This has caused dramatic declines and even extinction in at least 200 species of frog. Zoos are actively taking part in research aiming to stop the spread of this disease. Research in zoos contribute to a number of scientific fields including animal behaviour and endocrinology, all ultimately contributing to the conservation of our biodiversity. So sure, a trip to the zoo is a great family day out, but zoos these days aren't there to show off your new hippo. Zoos are centres for conservation, educating the new generation, giving critically endangered species another chance and helping us gather knowledge for the conservation of species and biodiversity.

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5. Mention any of the information that I wrote about above or anything I may have forgotten.Remember, please be polite but state your case.  This is the only chance we have and time is ticking away.  Please share this video with all of your animal loving friends and MAKE THAT CALL ASAP.Is this the change that the majority of Americans voted for in November?\nTranscript: you you you you you you you you you you\nComment: I believe that wolves do play a role in the ecosystem, but like all predators, they need to be kept in check. The biologist and hunters know more about this than any polotician. People need to understand what healthy numbers are, and what role people must play in this matter. What happens when they over populate? I asked and so I will answer for you. They starve, spread disease, and exterminate other species."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: Just one of those freak things that happen!  Thanks and we subbed back!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Top 3 Most Memorable Wild Animal Experiences Spawned from a viewer comment, I discuss 2 (actually 3) of my most memorable animal experiences while in the backcountry. And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: That porcupine was cool; lucky where you go there are actually animals. Everything is dead where I live, and I'm lucky if I see a lizard or deer. No interesting animals like moose, porcupines, elk, beavers, crocs, or anything like that here."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

She was hit by a car a few weeks back, and if you wonder why I'm kind of talking low, well right behind me, a few acres back, that's our rehab area, and that's where Bellina and any other rehab bobcats we might get live before they're released, and she's going to go there. It's a very naturalistic enclosure. There's lots of places for her to hide. We have her, her enclosure's a little bit set up for handicapped animals, did just have all that surgery on her leg, so it enables her to get around. So even though Bellina looks a little bit freaked out right now, she's running up and down the side of the closure. That's actually a good sign for us. It means she doesn't want to be caged up. She wants to get out of captivity, and the good thing about our rehab area, it's a very quiet area. It's nice and isolated, so she's going to be able to peacefully recover from her surgery back there. She'll sort of relearn how to hunt with her repaired leg, and really, even though she's stressed out right now, or she seems stressed out, she's going to have a good, quiet recovery, and there's no way she's going to get accustomed to people. So in the rehab bobcat cage, we have a way to feed them remotely, so we can put the prey animals, which are usually live rats, we can put them in these tubes, and the tubes have several different splits, and they can end up popping up in any area of the cage, and we have this enclosure completely covered with old trees, logs, brush, a lot of places for the prey animal to hide, as well as for the bobcat to hide, so they really have to fine-tune their senses, watch out for these prey animals, and really, it gets them ready for release back into the wild. She's still being fed dead prey right now, but in a couple weeks, we'll be able to feed live prey through the tubes, so she'll be able to relearn how to hunt, relearn how to use that repaired leg. You might wonder how we are aware of the progress of our rehab bobcats, and actually, what we do is we have several remote cameras back there, so we can watch the rehab enclosure from all angles, and we never have people around the enclosure. This really gives us a great idea of how well the animal is hunting, if it's hunting, and really, how ready it is for release. It's pretty amazing, and we're keeping our fingers crossed that real soon, come spring, when there's lots of prey animals out there, she'll be healthy and healed, and we can release her back like we have the previous ones. You can help us change the way people treat big cats by texting TIGER to 20222.\nComment: @samiuseliina  She actually had to go in for another surgery her leg wasn't healing properly, a slow recovery ahead but hopefully this will be the last of her surgeries, we'll update in the future, keep watching :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

That does save you a lot of 'Eagle Shit.'  Retired U.S. Marine.\nKeep in mind that Feeder Maintenance is of paramount importance. You should wash your feeders at LEAST twice a week. I cleanse mine with every feeding/refill, and i also use a vinegar solution every two weeks. It removes all the excess stickiness form the sugary nectar, and also helps to eliminate the harmful bacteria's  that can build  up over time.\nI have done pretty good with Hummers over the years. If you have any questions, Please feel free to ask, and Please do share as well.\nOne other helpful hand feeding idea that really works, but WATCH OUT!!   When you go out to have a  pleasant hand feeding session, put on a red shirt, but as i said;  WATCH OUT!!  You will get mobbed!!  Especially once your Hummers recognize you, which they will.

The sanctuary is a permanent home to over 100 rescued big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards. As well as smaller species like bobcats, servals, and sand cats. Campers arrive every day and get to explore our 55 acre property, making sure they say hello to the cats and taking lots of photos along the way. While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this. We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life. Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans. They get to do lots of fun activities, like making Big Cat popsicles and learning about our operant conditioning program and why it's so important to the cats at the sanctuary. Then campers observe Big Cat keepers handing out the popsicles they made and the cats willingly participating in our operant conditioning program.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: You guys need to do more to spread the word and publicize yourselves.

The white sticks out, so its chances of being seen by an eagle or a python, a mongoose, a rival predator, are so much greater. The normal coloured cubs, they blend with the forest floor, the leaf litter, the dappled light in the forest, they kind of disappear. The white cub sticks out like a beacon, very very vulnerable, and its colour makes it even more vulnerable. See the white tiger there trying to suckle on the other tiger, instinctive, gets no milk so immediately starts shouting. All three cubs now gone to sleep. Clambering over these rocks has taken it out of them, all their heads going down, little yawns, eyes closing, nice warm rocks, sun dropping now, temperature dropping, and they're all off for a nice little snooze. The number of sounds that I use to communicate with the cubs, I give a little purring sound, this is what a cheetah mother uses with her cubs, see how it calms them down, and then I use the little chuffing sound. See the other cubs are responding to the purr. Today the little cubs, just a month old, have had their first experience of water, and their first swimming experience. Now of all the big cats, tigers love the water the most. They live in areas where there are big monsoon rains, big rivers, and they will swim. In fact, in the Shundabans, they will swim 15 kilometers between the islands hunting for food. Watch how Shine helps Shunda climb out of the water. This is a typical den site that a tigress will use, nice little caves, and in here she can put these little cubs, get them into the crevices, and make it difficult for a rival predator to get inside. Now every few days, she will move those cubs to a new den site. When the scent builds up, the urine, the dung inside the den, it becomes smelly, and she takes the cub and moves it to a den site that she's found somewhere nearby.\nComment: You are their mom..."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: @jmu2k5 Thanks, I was checking some of your videos out last week when you sent the Friend request.

Big Cat Rescue recently installed a solar power system thanks to the generous support of The Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, TECO-Tampa Electrical and Solar Energy Management. We're so happy that the sanctuary was given the opportunity to help save the planet by utilizing green energy sources and we hope to expand in the future!Check in on our solar power system here:  Energy Management:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Big Cat Rescue is going greeeeen! What? What does this mean? Oh. Big Cat Rescue decided to do our part to help save the planet by installing a solar power system. The installation was made possible by grants from the Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, and a solar electric rebate from TECO. The overall cost of the installation was $18,250. It took the team from Solar Energy Management around three days to install the system. They have to make sure that the solar panels are at the optimal angle so they can capture as much energy as possible from the sun. Throughout the installation, the team were constantly supervised by the cats. In particular, Joseph and Sasha. And, of course, TJ the tiger who was very interested in what was happening around him. For the projected 25-year life of the system, annual utility savings are expected to average around $1,542. So this will total to over $38,000 in savings. And just as importantly, carbon dioxide emissions that will be saved over the life of the system is projected at 157 tons, which is equivalent to driving 314,000 automotive miles. The sanctuary will be using the energy to power all of our pool pumps. So our tigers will have a place to cool off. Max the bobcat can take the occasional dip. And we can constantly replace the water that TJ splashes out of his pool. Plus, any excess power goes backwards through the electrical meter and is supplied to the main office building. Solar Energy Management generously donated two extra panels to the sanctuary. So instead of 20 panels, we have 22. And all 22 individual modules have their own microinverter underneath the panel. What's a microinverter, you might ask? And that's the box right here. And that's the box right here. So the advantages to the microinverter technology are if partial shading occurs or bird droppings fall on a panel and it degrades the performance of this panel, it doesn't affect any of the rest of the panels, so you can maximize power production. And the data collected by all 22 microinverters is transferred to the communication gateway, which then verifies that they're functioning and transmits the data, which is collected every five minutes, wirelessly to the main office where we can check on their status. You can actually monitor the output and production from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. On the webpage, you can check that all the panels are functioning correctly, see how much energy they've produced over different periods of time, and see the environmental benefits to date, such as how the energy could be used. And you can even see how many trees we've saved with our carbon offset. We're so pleased that we've been able to take our first step towards using green energy, thanks to the generous support of several organizations. Our solar panel system is also very easy to add on to, so we hope to do this in the future and continue to do our part for the environment. And I'm sure TJ will enjoy the entertainment.

That's the pond pulled to bits, we've removed the large stones from around the side, we've kept them fairly local, just tipped them over the back there to allow us to reshape the top shelf, we've whipped the liner out, there was a little bit of underlay in, carpet underlay, probably covering about 20% of the pond, so it was there as a token gesture, no more, we've dragged the cobbles back a little bit, that'll allow us to build a proper shelf here to retain the cobbles and then just push them back in so they don't need to be moved twice, same with the stones, once we get the shelves done around the sides we'll just be able to lift the stones back into position and cement them in. Right this morning we've reshaped the pond, we've dug the shelves a little bit deeper all the way around the edges, we've created a new shelf around here, the idea being to put a little bit of cement all the way along here, cement in some of these fellas and then pile the rest behind it to prevent them falling in. We've made this inner shelf around here a little bit taller, i.e. a little bit nearer the surface because there wasn't much space for putting marginal plants before, that shelf was pretty deep, it was about 18 inches, which is no good for most plants, we've made another little shelf in the bottom here and we've basically just flattened everything out, ready for the underlay. That's the underlay in now, more or less went in in two long sheets, that's one sheet, that's another sheet, we've sealed it with a heat gun, basically just put a little bit of fire between the two layers and pressed them together in this stick. So now it's time for the liner. That's the liner in now, it's one mil rubber, Firestone liner, we've started filling it up, we're probably going to fill it up until it's just over this shelf here, that should pull the liner in enough for us to work on this top shelf, cementing the stones in. It's pretty important to fill it up sufficiently so it pulls the liner in and makes it tight, otherwise if you just bray on and put the edging stones on when the liner's loose, when you fill it up, it can pull the edging stones in and make a real mess. This is the edging just about half done, we're putting a little ring of cobbles cemented in around the beach edge here, then we can cut the liner off, pour the cobbles back over that and it retains the cobbles quite nicely. We've gone round the sides with stone, well gone halfway round the side with stone, obviously the water's still got quite a long way to come up, but we're going to stop it just shy of those stones there, just in case we get any rain overnight, we don't want it to affect the cement that we've put on. All these gaps will be filled in with soil and then we'll cut the liner off. It's coming together quite well. It's the end of today, we've cemented all the edging stones on, put the cobbles back in position, had a bit of a tidy up around the edges, the water's still got to go up by 8 or 9 inches or so to cover the exposed liner there, but we're leaving it at this level just so it doesn't interfere with the cement. So really now all there is to do is just leave it for a couple of days, top it up and then get the video of the finished pond. That's about it. We've filled the pond up to about 6 inches below its full level, that's to allow the cement that we put around here to go off properly, that was the last bit of cementing that we did, so it'll still come up, probably halfway up these stones that surround the pond here. It's reasonably clear because most of it is water straight out of the tap, although we did put a little bit of pond water back in, it was probably about 300-400 litres went back in. That's it, another one down. If you've liked this video, click the like button, give it a thumbs up, if you haven't liked it, go away and watch some cat playing a blooming keyboard or something.

On 08.03.08, this storm hit the US midsection during a year which already had bad storms. The storm is shown in another video, Great Blizzard 2008, Record Breaking, Storm of Century,  video was made one day afterwards. The wildlife were getting hungry. Here two doe and two fawns come up to the bird feeder (they generally inspect it after dark). Although they were very hungry, they were even more curious about the cat. Deer do not appear to understand what domestic animals are and are exceedingly curious.The cat was curious also. The deer kept their distance, but spent some time looking over the cat. One fawn seemed to not be in the best of a mood. It hit its mother with a hoof at least twice (at ~ .46 and 1.2).The deer kept getting closer to the cat by hiding behind the snow drift, then going back to the tree. The snow was so deep that the deer could hardly run through it, when they left.The previous Video begins with view of field and trees taken immediately (~1-2 days) before the storm. Wildlife includes whitetail deer (which are loosing their antlers), wild turkeys, turkey vultures (sighted here for first time of year), and crows. Video then shows blizzard beginning at night. Nighttime animals out included raccoons (only 1 was photographed) and a coyote. These animals were videotaped in infrared. The  storm was getting bad during the coyote filming. Video then shows view of the storm. Only the closest trees were visible during the whiteout, as compared to the normal view of the area. Small snow whirlwinds, tornados, and gusts traveled across the landscape. Snow was cleared here with backhoe.The record breaking snow fall was 20.4 inches. The previous mark in Ohio for snow during 1 storm was 15.3 inches. And this record was made in 1910. Blizzard was compared to the famous blizzard of 1978. Streets were closed, a snow emergency was declared, and plane travel stopped (although I heard a jet while I was filming the coyote). A level 3 snow emergency was declared in many counties. Freeways were closed. Cities had parking bans. Contingents of several snow plows pulled through, some slid off the road. Many accidents occurred. People intending to vacation in warm places were stuck in Ohio.After the storm traffic was still stopped. The streets were used for sledding and snowboarding.Additional views of wild deer on the farm include:LARGE BUCK FIGHT-LOCK ANTLERS, ENTANGLED, CLOSE WHITETAIL  Non-Typical Moose-Sized Buck DEER - ACTION SHOTS RARE WHITE WILD WHITETAIL BUCK  views of this white deer: white deer on the farm -- the banded one & sibling: white deer being stalked by coyotes: strange deer on the farm deer fighting bucks run and jump bucks fighting COYOTES VS.

Even a small wild cat can inflict serious injury.In this episode we look at a lesser cat called the Caracal. Their name is taken from a Turkish word that means \"black ear.\" The Caracal is known best for its large black ears that it uses for its great hunting ability.The Caracal roams the grasslands and open plains from Africa through the Middle East. While its numbers are holding in Africa, we see populations becoming extinct in India due to farming and the unrestricted manufacturing of charcoal from the wild weeds, especially in the Banni grasslands. By supporting animal conservation in these areas we can help save the land for the Caracals and other wildlife. Captive Caracals in the US suffer from people trying to keep them as pets, as well as trying to crossbreed them with domestic cats for the pet trade.For more info about BIG CAT RESCUE visit:  us on FACEBOOK:     YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, so today's species spotlight is on the caracal, which most people say, what is a caracal? Well, we're going to show you one and talk a little bit about them. That is Crackle, and she is a caracal. Caracals are sometimes called desert lynx, but in all reality, they are more closely related to your domestic cat at home than to any of the lynx, being either Siberian lynx or Canadian lynx. One of the characteristics that make them very unique is the fact that they have a pretty plain solid coat. There are only a few other cats that have that sort of coat without markings, and that would be cougars and lions, and strangely enough, they are about the same color as the caracals. The caracals have jet black ears, the back of their ears are black, and they have long tufts, just like the lynx, so that's probably why a lot of people associated them with the lynx or thought they were related. So caracals are found throughout Africa, and they're actually found through the Middle East and parts of Asia, and strangely enough, geographically, caracals are found in the same areas that you find cheetahs. Cheetahs and caracals were found in actually the same locations, and one of the things about these two species is they were both trained by humans to hunt animals on behalf of the humans. So the caracals were trained to hunt birds, rabbits, small gazelles, and of course the cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey. Very fascinating that both of these animals were not tamed, but conditioned by humans to hunt animals, and there was actually contests at one time between the caracals to see which one could kill the most birds, the most pigeons in a flock, and the cheetahs, which one could go fastest and bring down the biggest prey. For the most part, the smaller cats, the smaller predators, they eat animals relative to their size, so they would eat smaller birds or mice, but the caracals actually go after much larger prey. So one of the coolest things about the caracals is that they have this uncanny leaping ability, and they can actually catch birds on the wing. They've been recorded in the wild as jumping up to three meters high, which is almost about as high as I am right now. One of the other facts about caracals is they often live in the plains, and a lot of times they're found where the forest meets the plains. This does put them vulnerable to lions, hyenas, leopards, some of the bigger predators, and oftentimes they do fall prey to these larger animals. So they're not always the hunter, a lot of times they become the hunted. So one of the strange things about the caracal is in a lot of their range, especially in Asia and the Middle East, they're considered endangered, because they're very rare. And then on the other hand, in Africa, a lot of times caracals are considered nuisance, and they're just simply killed because they're a threat to livestock. Here at Big Cat Rescue, all of our caracals were former pets. Along with the serval, the caracal is just very popular among cat collectors, and probably one of the biggest misconceptions with the caracals is the fact that they are so cute when they are babies. They are the most adorable little kittens you've ever seen. Most people don't realize they're going to grow up to be this hissy animal that's going to spray on everything and try to bite you all the time. And there's been several attempts to hybridize these animals, some successful, some not successful, with domestic cats to give everyone sort of an exotic cat that's not quite wild. To me, that's a pretty shady thing to do. These are truly wild animals, great hunters out in the wild. They shouldn't be put in cages. They absolutely shouldn't be diluted down with domestic cat DNA. That's not what they were made to be. And here at Big Cat Rescue, of course, our philosophy is these animals belong in the wild, and the only way that we can ever accomplish that is if we preserve enough habitat in the \nComment: I love to learn.

The cats' efforts were captured by high-definition and slow-motion cameras for the Saving a Species series for teachers.Subscribe to our channel on YouTube:  to our print magazine:  our Blog:  us on Twitter:  a fan on Facebook:  our TV show: \nTranscript: Today we're shooting an episode of Shamu TV. It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection. It's just something that we've been doing for a long time.

It was run as a cattle ranch and given to my parents in 1952 and handed over to Jane and I in 1977 to run. It was purely a cattle operation. 1983 Anna Mertz came to Lewa and offered to develop a rhino sanctuary on Lewa. I, Jane, we had a strong affiliation with wildlife and it was a wonderful opportunity for us to do something new and different and Lewa was the right place. So between 1983 and 1995 we looked after rhino in a very small area. 1995 we established a charitable organisation, the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, because everything was growing and we realised we had to go bigger if we were going to save rhino, that it was more about people and politics and money and all the dynamics around conservation than a single species. Lewa Downs as such, the ecological unit of Lewa Downs is 62,000 acres. Some of that is a national forest reserve owned by government. The rest of that land is owned by different parts of my family and as a family we all know that we have a massive responsibility in caring for that land, for caring for the Grevy's zebra, for the black rhino on that land. Like every family in the world, we have children, we want to pass on what we own to our children and it's a threat to Lewa. It's going to divide the core ownership of it and so my brother, my sister and I have come together and with the support of my parents and said let's put this into an organisation that's going to take it beyond us and TNC have guided us carefully over the last two years through that process and so the land that's been in my family since 1922 will be in a Kenya-based charitable organisation focused on conservation that will take our work into the foreseeable future. Once TNC made the decision to come into Africa, I think there was a sort of gravitational connection there. There was an obvious connection in a lot of key issues that where we were weak and TNC was strong. We were ground-based, we were relatively humble, we had the buy-in of the communities and the government but we didn't have an international reach and we didn't have the expertise, the technical expertise to sort of formalise a lot of the issues that we were doing here on the ground. It's this expertise that's evolved and is available within TNC and that's what's been so valuable to us in this relationship.

With him I had the privilege of watching and recording a very special moment for this story: dingo pups being born in their lair.It is just one special moment in a story about a farmer who has come up with an unusual way of keeping wild dogs under control on his property.    by Ant On Wax\"Before You Accuse Me\" blues standard performed by Harmonica Rick Gibson soundcloud.com/harmonica-rick-gibson\nTranscript: Australian farmers have a responsibility to control dingoes, or wild dogs, that are running on their property. So about three years ago, I made a decision to change my strategy about controlling wild dogs on my property and decided to go and look for the young at brooding time, which was July. The dingoes have their pups in July. And I was lucky enough to find two litters, and having reared a couple of those dingoes, I got to the understanding that I could probably try a policy of having my own dingo pack and regularly walk them around my property and might be able to control the other of the wild dingo pack by letting them know there was already a pack of dogs in this area. The culmination of my efforts through removing these pups from the hollow logs means that now I have mature dingoes, who are now brooding age, and just only a few nights ago I was very privileged to be present for the birth of my own. I'm right up close and it's all happening just natural like a wood in the bush, except the dingo doesn't have a fear of me and accepts me in. I just feel so privileged to be able to be right up close to something that is normally so secretive. An interesting characteristic I found with dingoes, they don't normally bark, but they have a whole heap of other noises they make in communication, quiet communications, and they do a very throaty, I think a dingo could almost talk. Come up here baby. Yes I will. My lovely dingo baby. Go on. And I learned early on sitting here by the campfire, when I had dingo pups beside me, that when I played the harmonica, they all went into howl. I don't really know whether they think I'm sad or what it is with the harmonica that really gets into them, but all they want to do is come and sit beside me and howl with me. I feed my dingoes a variety of foods. I like to get a big boiler, half fill it with water, put in vegetables. I try to give them as much native food that they would naturally have got themselves. You can't always count on a roadkill kangaroo or something coming along when you need it. They all seem quite happy. I think they do well on it as a matter of fact. I feel privileged to have actually seen what happens with dingoes right up close. They're so misunderstood in Australia. I really realise how much they have accepted me as I'm just one of a number. And I have some very good traits. All dingoes have their part in the pack. I suppose one of my best traits must be they consider me a good cook. Baa! Eee! No!

I think this tiger thinks it's coming to get us. We're at the zoo. We're behind glass. We've been sitting here for a while. And this tiger has just been watching us. And it's come out from behind the glass. And I hope it's playing. It's still behind the glass. It's not from behind the log, I mean. It had been kind of following us and watching us for a while. Oh, I think it is going to pounce at us. It looks so big. I think we should be on our go now. I think it is going to pounce at us. I'm scared. I hope it shatters the glass. It can't. Is it going to come? I think she's just curious about us. Oh, I put my head up and she stopped. I think she just wants to get to know us. Man, look at the nature channel. Put the picture down, Benton. I'm going to show it to her. So, I really hope that glass is firm. This tiger is coming to make friends with us, Benton. Holy cow, look at this. Oh my gosh. Holy cow.\nComment: Tigers have amazing concentration and strategic moves. They dont loose patience. It is very scary to see a tiger that is so focussed on you."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This is Wendy the Guide Girl, also known as Hawk Hunter Diva if you're watching YouTube. I'm sitting in my own back pasture instead of down at the leaves, shopping for some venison. I haven't seen anything I wanted to fling an arrow at yet. I'm in the antler hunting mode. So I got some new stuff from Buzzy. It's called Bowhunter Setup Scrape Juice. So I'm going to test that out today and see if I can't bring in something new. I see something just jumped the fence and I haven't seen it before. So let's check it out and see if he's a shooter. Well, good evening. Welcome to Butch and Wendy's Hunting Adventures. Hawk Hunter Diva decided to go try to get some venison. So we're here in the Hill Country, Texas. The deer are a little smaller up here compared to South Texas or up north, but we have a whole lot of them. I've been sitting in a pop-up blind watching a stream of does and little bucks and stuff. And I was actually after this eight point buck. He was nice and mature, but he didn't come in this morning. And while I was sitting there, this little ten point came in. Well, for the Hill Country, he's a nice little deer. And I decided to go ahead and take him. I had a good hunt. It was nice. And another deal was, the wind wasn't quite blowing right. It's kind of switching around because we have a front coming in. Right now it's 76 degrees here in Central Texas, but tomorrow it's going to be 35 degrees. So actually I was even hunting in shorts this evening. But anyway, the wind was swirling. The deer kept coming in. They were a little spooky. So I'll tell you what I did. I got this Muzzy's Bowhunter set up, the scrape juice, and I sprayed a little bit out the window. And he came in shortly afterwards, but I'll tell you what, don't spray it inside the blind. It smells pretty rough, but I bet deer really like it because I had never seen this buck before out of all the deer I've been watching for the past couple of weeks. And it brought him in, so I guess it works. But have a good evening. Muzzy Phantom did the job, shot him with a crossbow. Central Hill Country of Texas, and it's October 27th, 2010. Y'all have a good evening. We're going to try to go get some more venison here this season, but I guess I'm going to have to change clothes and get something warm. See y'all next time. Later.\nComment: I havent seen horns in years. nice hunt, nice buck Wendy! I never even seen the arrow go! Or hear it. Awesome footage Wendy!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5. Mention any of the information that I wrote about above or anything I may have forgotten.Remember, please be polite but state your case.  This is the only chance we have and time is ticking away.  Please share this video with all of your animal loving friends and MAKE THAT CALL ASAP.Is this the change that the majority of Americans voted for in November?\nTranscript: you you you you you you you you you you\nComment: I called a cuple days ago and so have a few of my friends. im trying to get more but thank you for posting this.

She had been a house pet, and the woman could no longer afford to feed her, and she was literally starving to death. And the woman turned her loose here into her outdoor enclosure. She told her to go and to be free and to eat. And that's exactly what she's done, and she's been just a wonderful animal. She's really enjoyed Crackle. Here of late, though, she's been sick. We found her in her den, just being cold and unresponsive, so we brought her into the camp hospital. And our big cat rescuers have been hand-feeding her and giving her lots of attention. She's perked up beautifully, and it's raining outside. So until we have better weather, we'll keep her inside here. We're going to keep her warm and dry. Even the rain doesn't deter people from coming to see the big cats. Of course, most of the big cats don't mind the rain at all.\nComment: Caracalserval111, Cheetahs are very fascinating cats.

It's Great value, well camouflaged, well made, easy to put up and take down, not like the fold away dome hides at all. It's all waterproof and I was using it today in the pouring rain and didn't get wet at all ( though you will if u have the zip part of the windows down as rain gets through the mesh). All in all a very happy purchase, just hope I get some good use from it.\nTranscript: Hello, this is my review of the One Man Photography Chairhide. As you can see it's nice and camouflaged. The one-way lining is velcro strapped. So you can tear that down and have a nice little opening to point your camera out. The front zips down, so you have a nice wide opening if you want a better view. Have a look in the air for any birds of prey. But today I've been using it zipped up like this and it's worked really well. The birds can't see me at all. I've got some nice photographs of some starlings on there and a robin as well. The chairhide's got plenty of room inside. It can be pegged down, comes with a nice carry bag. The backpack fits on your back. It weighs about 5kg, which is quite heavy. But with the backpack sticking on your back it shouldn't be too bad. There's a few windows here. One there, one there. Same on the other side. We've got one-way viewing mesh, so you can see out but they can't see in. And you can velcro them down as well, so you can have the thing completely open if you like. There's also these little covers. They just zip down like that, let you see out. Well, it's one-way but from a distance. If you want to get in, just lift the front up. It's a bit of a faff one-handed, but... Alright, maybe quite a faff one-handed. There you go, you can go the same side. It is a lot easier when you've got two hands to use. It's a nice comfy chair, about the same as you get in a camp stove. Cup holder. Nice inside, easy to put up, easy to take down. Only take you a couple of minutes to put it away. Loads of room inside, you can fit your tripod in. And a camera bag as well. Really nice chair hide, this one's the Stealth Gear one. From Morris Photography for about £75. Really great value. Apart from the weight, which makes it a bit awkward to take with you everywhere you go. But if you set somewhere up, feed a station, it should work a treat. You get some great photos, birds don't even know you're there.\nComment: Thanks ! Just what i was looking for ,just ordered one,) "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: I think the best way to answer your question is to send you to the website where you can get all the facts and a timeline explaining white tigers.

We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around.\nComment: @CyprusHot Well you should not use the LORD's name in a sarcasm or a joke. Also that verse is out of context because that verse is referring to an animal owned by some one (a domestic animal or cattle)as it says \"...cares for the needs of HIS animal...\" Therefore it does not apply to wild animals who are threatening humans. Also, in 1 Samuel 17:34-37 killing wild animals in self-defense is justified.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

I'd like to introduce Anthony and Steve Moore from Kansas. I've invited them down here to do a little hog hunting. Father and son team, never been hog hunting before, done a lot of deer hunting in our time and we thought we'd try something different and sure appreciate the opportunity to hunt with Michael. You're welcome. Tell you what, let's head to the tree stands and see if we can't get them on a hog. We'll see you there at the stand. Alright, well we finally made it down in here to our stands. As you can tell, it is a muddy mess down here. So when it's time to drag one out that we shoot, it ought to slide out of here pretty easy. Pick you one out. See that one sitting there? Shoot it. That one right there. Good shot. I hit the door. Well, I couldn't tell from here until I saw it kick in. Well, Anthony, that was some good shooting. Looks like that was only 50 yards away and getting closer all the time and the first time you ever shot anything. Thank you, Michael Grandstaff, for this hunt. Alright, well I want to thank you all for coming down here to Texas and I hope you all enjoyed this hog hunt. Yes, we did. It was fantastic even if we didn't get to shoot a hog, just to see that many hogs and see the place was exciting enough. Well, I guess it's time to go to work, huh?

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: Heart-less people.. This pisses me off with ANY animal.\nMy father is a deer hunter thats the only taxidermy I have. Why do people do these things? It makes me think of how much they care about nature....

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Wolves delisted Again 3/06/2009 URGENT Photos courtesy of  those of you who are unaware of this, the new Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar has delisted the wolves in Western Great Lakes and the Rocky Mountain states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Utah as of March 6th, 2009.  Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Top 3 Most Memorable Wild Animal Experiences Spawned from a viewer comment, I discuss 2 (actually 3) of my most memorable animal experiences while in the backcountry. And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: Great moments.  I remember those times from your past videos."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets. A female red fox is known as a vixen, and a male red fox is known as a dog fox; a fox baby is known as a kit or cub.\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: Adorable!

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: Thanks for the specification. I seriously thought I was nonhuman before you mentioned this, truly, thanks for the relevation. haha\nUnfortunately, I cannot follow your general guideline for \"human survival.\" I'm not that selfish, needless to say, just like you mentioned, no matter what we focus on, no matter what we do, we're bound to the same end.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Nature and Trees - A Squirrel - A Wonderful Creation Of Nature (Pls Watch in Full HD 720 or 1080 )I found this amazing Grizzled Giant Squirrel on a tree in front of my resort hotel room during my holidays. There were a few notices put up by the hotel indicating that wild animals are not to be fed. Since this squirrel looked rather tame and more familiar with the surroundings I thought of giving it a banana :) May be it was used to the hotel guests feeding it. I was very close and was able to admire it while it was feeding itself. The surrounding of the resort hotel chalet where we stayed was rather interior and was bordering a Wildlife Sanctuary. Grizzled Giant Squirrel - (Ratufa Macroura) ================================= The grizzled giant squirrel is a large tree squirrel found in the highlands of Sri Lanka and India. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as near threatened due to habitat loss and hunting. Countries - Native - India , Sri Lanka Taxonomic Notes - There are three very distinct subspecies, with one present in India and all three present in Sri Lanka. Red List Category & Criteria - Near Threatened Justification - Listed as Near Threatened because this species is probably in significant decline due to habitat loss and hunting throughout much of its range. Range Description - This species is endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. In India it is known from only five severely fragmented locations, while it occurs more widely and less fragmented in Sri Lanka. Population - The Indian population has been estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals, and the population has been decling due to habitat loss and hunting The population of this species is considerably higher in Sri Lanka. Habitat and Ecology - It is a diurnal and arboreal species. It occurs in tropical dry deciduous and montane forests, where it is confined to the riverine habitats. It has a generation time of ~7-8 years. Major Threats- Habitat loss and degradation due to agro-industry farming, small-scale logging, selective logging, increase in human settlements, forest fire, inter-specific competition, competition from alien species, hunting for local consumption purposes, presence of domestic predators have been observed to be the major threats for this species. The grizzled giant squirrel's common name came from the grey to brown colouration highlighted with white at the top of the tail, giving it a grizzled appearance. The rest of the body varies in colour geographically and may be brown, red, grey or black, but the fur on the underside is always lighter than the back. This agile climber is adapted for life spent almost entirely in the trees, and has a very long tail for balance, broad hands for climbing and large claws for gripping branches. The ears are short, round and sometimes tufted.Music By Lohstana David from Jamendo .com\nTranscript: \nComment: I enjoyed watching this squirrel, while it was feeding on the banana. I love its face - so cute, especially in close-up range. Like all squirrels it looks so adorable. I love the munching part with the music - so funny... It's really a big one  squirrel and very unusual in this respect. It cannot be as fast as other small squirrels are and it could be a problem for surviving. Thank you for this wonderful video.

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets. A female red fox is known as a vixen, and a male red fox is known as a dog fox; a fox baby is known as a kit or cub.\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: In case anyone is wondering.

I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: I looked this up..and this is a good insightful video and I thank you for sharing it. I looked it up because I new it was a serious problem, when I watched another video boasting about getting white tigers...from a Zoo that was closing down who had many of them. I actually dried when I saw white tigers in my area in a small closed in Zoo with no where to roam in Bridgeton NJ. You are right, this must be stopped. Thank you for this video.

They suspect that poachers killed their mother for her pelt. At first, everyone thinks they're leopard cubs. It turns out they're the rarest of finds. Two clouded leopard cubs. The find captures the imagination of top Indian wildlife photographer Sandesh Kadur. Cats have always fascinated me, and when I heard about these clouded leopards being rehabilitated back into the wild, I dropped everything and rushed to the spot to document the whole process. In terms of filming a new species of cat, I mean, this was it. This is the holy grail. Clouded leopards are amazing creatures, the smallest of the big cats. Shy and elusive, even cat specialists know little about their habits in the wild. Just keeping them alive is a big challenge. A leading vet, Dr. Bhaskar Chowdhury, takes charge of caring for these very special cubs. That was the first experience for me to see wild clouded leopard cubs for the first time in my life. So I was really excited and also a bit nervous because the onus is on us, the veterinarians, to make them survive. Bhaskar is determined that the cubs don't end up in the zoo like most orphaned big cats. He gets permission to try something totally unprecedented, to teach clouded leopard cubs how to be wild. It's totally new, never been tried, never been tested, and people, you know, many scientists won't believe this. It's a huge gamble. If his new protocol succeeds, it will boost dwindling numbers of clouded leopards in their real home, the forest. If they get it wrong, the cubs will die.\nComment: I have seen the entire programme on Nat Geo. After acclimatising these cubs in the wild , under observation & after another year of releasing the cubs in the wild , at Manas Sanctuary , spanning on the borders of India & Bhutan , there were ample signs of atleast one cub surviving . Thats a splendid job done by Dr. Bhaskar Jyoti Choudhury & his team."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

I didn't do research, but it seems that the Axis Doe esterus cycle can occur any time during the year, unlike the Whitetail which they all go into esterus at the same time.

He was bouncing in the timber already, strutting out in front of us. I couldn't shoot him for a long time because he was so close to it, but I'm pretty sure we got a decent shot off. It didn't screw up the decoy too bad, but it put him down, so let's go out here and see what he looks like. Well, opening morning's paid off pretty good for us. I'd done some pretty good scouting here, and the pictures were showing the birds were here, but man, when we set up this morning, we wasn't very confident in it. We had some birds quite a ways behind us, and then over here across the creek, we knew there were some birds. Well, we even talked about getting up and moving, but we went ahead and stuck it out for another 20, 30 minutes, and one of the birds we'd heard over across the creek, evidently he had moved in on us, and we didn't see him until he was about 30 yards away.

Finally breaking the camera out again and decided to walk some land in search of sheds, enjoy!\nTranscript: Hey guys, what's up? It's Champlea7. I know I haven't made a video in a super long time, but my camera is actually out of commission right now. I left it at my buddy's house and I haven't seen him for about two months. I went on a hog hunt with him, so I'm using my buddy, the Texas Bone Hunters video camera. And I'm back here on a wildlife management area today near my house in Dallas, Texas. It's about 15 minutes from my house and there's got to be a couple thousand acres back here I'm thinking. I mean, there is just a ton of land to come in here and I mean, I'm kind of just trail hopping right now. I'm doing a shed hunting video today. It's January the 27th or the 28th, one of the two days, Saturday, but I'm back here ready to find some sheds, hopefully bring you guys a quality video, so stay tuned. Well, guys, I know you're probably watching this video to get a couple of shed hunting information from me, so I'm going to share some with you right now, guys. First thing, this is a really new area to me. I really haven't come back here a lot. I've come back here to do a little bit of bow fishing. You might have seen some of my bow fishing videos, but I noticed a lot of the land that was back from where I bow fish is a wildlife management area, so that's why I'm in here today. This is really my first time in here and what you want to do, you really want to pick apart your cover whenever you're shed hunting. Look for any sort of geographic region that might hold deer more, like openings within some really heavily wooded forests. Look for a sign. Keep away from those areas that are devoid of signs. Try not to trail hop. I'm really guilty of doing that a lot. I do get lucky sometimes trail hopping, but you could probably find a lot more if you look for a sign. I've got a rub right here in front of me. These deer in Texas actually rut around late December into January, so I know that this is probably kind of fresh and there's some deer hanging around here, but I know a lot of bucks still haven't shed right now, especially here in the Lone Star State because we're so far south. It's really not a hard winter on these deer, so I'm really looking for older sheds maybe. Just anything that might be in here. There's a ton of woods. There's no way someone's covered at all, so I'm going to try to get a couple finds. So stick around. Hey guys, the Texas bone hunter is over here. He's found some bone. Let's see what he's got. He's probably already picked it up here. Man, this is some thick stuff. I can't believe deer are walking through here. Yeah, I know. That is a very nice shed. Was it laying right there? Well, yeah. I mean, it's not even chewed up or anything, dude. Yeah. That's an awesome shed. It's all... Yeah, it's in very good condition. Very good condition. I don't know how long I've been wanting to find a shed for myself, dude, now. Yeah? I'm so pumped. So it was right here, huh? Yeah. Wow. Very nice. Well guys, just found this bad boy right here. Little boar, it looks like. Pretty good cutters on him, actually. This spot of the woods back here is definitely dominated by pigs. You can just tell it's all tore up in here and pigs everywhere. But I found the bottom skull and then found the top skull not even 5 or 10 yards away from it. Pretty easy find and a pretty cool thing to add to my collection. So we're starting to hit some bone here now, whether it be skull or actual sheds. We'll keep in tune, guys, so stay with us. Hey guys, just found my first antler here. I haven't even gone to pick it up yet. I'm going to do an ATL picture of it with my phone and on the camera. But I am excited. It looks really good. I'm about 15 yards away from it right now. So let's go see it. Oh man. Wow, that's a good shed. Ha. Guys, we're on some wildlife management area land here. In Texas. And by God, he's got a split brow. It's pretty nice. A G2 and G3 and he's pretty chunky for being back here. Man. Well, that's awesome. I'm glad we got one, guys. I'm ready to go find some more. Oh my God. Wow. Alright. I ain't kidding you guys right now. I just want to do a walking away shot with this shed. And there's another shed not even laying 10 yards away. Right on the same trail. Looks to be pretty old. So there's some more. Shed's obviously to be found. Keep watching, guys. Wow. Alright, guys. What I'm doing now is what's called gridding. After finding those two antlers, there's a pretty good chance that the other one's going to be pretty close by. So what you want to do is wherever you found that antler, just kind of go back and forth. Help you use landmarks. And trying to find the other side. Basically making a big sweep where you can't miss it. You're not trail hopping. You're doing more of a systematic search. So stay with me. And I'll check in if I get anything. Thanks for watching!\nComment: @TheBoneheadpro Thanks Craig! Always good to hear from a fellow shed hunting nut like myself!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Even a small wild cat can inflict serious injury.In this episode we look at a lesser cat called the Caracal. Their name is taken from a Turkish word that means \"black ear.\" The Caracal is known best for its large black ears that it uses for its great hunting ability.The Caracal roams the grasslands and open plains from Africa through the Middle East. While its numbers are holding in Africa, we see populations becoming extinct in India due to farming and the unrestricted manufacturing of charcoal from the wild weeds, especially in the Banni grasslands. By supporting animal conservation in these areas we can help save the land for the Caracals and other wildlife. Captive Caracals in the US suffer from people trying to keep them as pets, as well as trying to crossbreed them with domestic cats for the pet trade.For more info about BIG CAT RESCUE visit:  us on FACEBOOK:     YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, so today's species spotlight is on the caracal, which most people say, what is a caracal? Well, we're going to show you one and talk a little bit about them. That is Crackle, and she is a caracal. Caracals are sometimes called desert lynx, but in all reality, they are more closely related to your domestic cat at home than to any of the lynx, being either Siberian lynx or Canadian lynx. One of the characteristics that make them very unique is the fact that they have a pretty plain solid coat. There are only a few other cats that have that sort of coat without markings, and that would be cougars and lions, and strangely enough, they are about the same color as the caracals. The caracals have jet black ears, the back of their ears are black, and they have long tufts, just like the lynx, so that's probably why a lot of people associated them with the lynx or thought they were related. So caracals are found throughout Africa, and they're actually found through the Middle East and parts of Asia, and strangely enough, geographically, caracals are found in the same areas that you find cheetahs. Cheetahs and caracals were found in actually the same locations, and one of the things about these two species is they were both trained by humans to hunt animals on behalf of the humans. So the caracals were trained to hunt birds, rabbits, small gazelles, and of course the cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey. Very fascinating that both of these animals were not tamed, but conditioned by humans to hunt animals, and there was actually contests at one time between the caracals to see which one could kill the most birds, the most pigeons in a flock, and the cheetahs, which one could go fastest and bring down the biggest prey. For the most part, the smaller cats, the smaller predators, they eat animals relative to their size, so they would eat smaller birds or mice, but the caracals actually go after much larger prey. So one of the coolest things about the caracals is that they have this uncanny leaping ability, and they can actually catch birds on the wing. They've been recorded in the wild as jumping up to three meters high, which is almost about as high as I am right now. One of the other facts about caracals is they often live in the plains, and a lot of times they're found where the forest meets the plains. This does put them vulnerable to lions, hyenas, leopards, some of the bigger predators, and oftentimes they do fall prey to these larger animals. So they're not always the hunter, a lot of times they become the hunted. So one of the strange things about the caracal is in a lot of their range, especially in Asia and the Middle East, they're considered endangered, because they're very rare. And then on the other hand, in Africa, a lot of times caracals are considered nuisance, and they're just simply killed because they're a threat to livestock. Here at Big Cat Rescue, all of our caracals were former pets. Along with the serval, the caracal is just very popular among cat collectors, and probably one of the biggest misconceptions with the caracals is the fact that they are so cute when they are babies. They are the most adorable little kittens you've ever seen. Most people don't realize they're going to grow up to be this hissy animal that's going to spray on everything and try to bite you all the time. And there's been several attempts to hybridize these animals, some successful, some not successful, with domestic cats to give everyone sort of an exotic cat that's not quite wild. To me, that's a pretty shady thing to do. These are truly wild animals, great hunters out in the wild. They shouldn't be put in cages. They absolutely shouldn't be diluted down with domestic cat DNA. That's not what they were made to be. And here at Big Cat Rescue, of course, our philosophy is these animals belong in the wild, and the only way that we can ever accomplish that is if we preserve enough habitat in the \nComment: you guys are really good people & i love your videos & share them often :) to keep spreading the point of conservation !  and that these animals need our help"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: Yes they are iron sights, actually the back sight is broken in this video.  Use it as a bead barrel to make it more of a challenge.

First released by Captain Cook for a food source for the pioneers of this country, the Feral Pig has thrived in our conditions and multiplied to almost plague proportions. Up here in the territory, the good living has seen the Feral Pig population explode. Cape York is probably the first destination most people think of when they think of pig hunting, but up here in the territory, their numbers are just as strong. I've heard of boars up to around 240 kilos being caught in the territory, but between 80 and 100 kilos is a good sized boar. They are an environmental terrorist, destroying vast tracts of land. In the south, they destroy crops and livestock, decimating the income of our already struggling farmers. Up here in the north, they tear our wetlands and national parks to shreds. No wetland has been left untouched. They act as carriers of weeds and exotic diseases, and they tear up the land until it becomes a mess of impassable pig ruts. Anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of driving across them will know what I mean. With a keen sense of smell, excellent hearing, and razor sharp tusks, pigs can be considered as dangerous game. Wounded animals are especially dangerous, and I've had a few close calls with wounded boars. There seems to be a lot of difference in opinion on what is the best calibre of hunting pigs. My opinion is, if it kills them, use it. I've shot them with everything from a .22 to a .375 Ultramag, but the latter can get quite expensive when you look at how many pigs we have up here. The smaller calibres can have problems penetrating the thick fighting pads and mud on the larger boars, so aiming at the base of the ear is your best bet when shooting with a small calibre. When using the bigger calibres, aiming tight behind the shoulder has always yielded good results for me. Herds of 30 or more are not uncommon. A group of animals this large will destroy a patch of dirt bigger than a football field every single food sitting. The feral pig is a real menace, and we as hunters need to do our part.\nComment: Hey Karl watch out boy just see the tusks and the size of them can’t take the dogs no count only machine gun can stop them"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

That may mean habitat loss for local animals.  Now, a strip of woods near HSUS headquarters is being developed.   Here's a look at how some animals are surviving.\nTranscript: For the animals living in this patch of woods, home is changing. Really large equipment is going to come and knock these trees down and it's going to be a real upheaval. A property near the headquarters of the Humane Society of the United States will soon be filled with pavement. The road is going to come right through here along this fence line and it's going to go right along these burrow sites. Earth movers are breaking ground, putting many animals, including groundhogs and fox, in harm's way. They wouldn't make it. Fox and groundhogs would likely not make it. The animals would get buried alive, especially since this is ground zero. We know this is where the road is coming through, so we know this area is going to be completely altered. And most of it is going to be gone. So many animals are being relocated. The trapping effort is sort of the last ditch effort to get the remaining animals out of the burrow systems. Take this groundhog brought to a new home miles away. But here she'll be safe. And HSU's staff is stepping in to make sure others survive the habitat loss. I'm fortunate that these animals have been living here for countless years and are going to be losing their homes, so I want to just dedicate a little bit of my time to try to help them and save their lives ultimately. It's sort of, I guess, representative of what's happening across America with increasing development and urban sprawl and so forth. Got him. Got him? Yeah. The more people, the better, because the more ground we can cover, the more intensely we can sweep, and the likelihood, you know, of finding more animals and getting them off the site to save them improves. Destroyed. But it's hard to see them, real hard to see. With some encouragement, many animals did move on their own. Now an entirely new home awaits, and hopefully soon enough, this will feel like home. Hopefully we're doing the best we can, giving as many animals a chance as we can.\nComment: This is very sad."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: I hope this raises more awareness..."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

With him I had the privilege of watching and recording a very special moment for this story: dingo pups being born in their lair.It is just one special moment in a story about a farmer who has come up with an unusual way of keeping wild dogs under control on his property.    by Ant On Wax\"Before You Accuse Me\" blues standard performed by Harmonica Rick Gibson soundcloud.com/harmonica-rick-gibson\nTranscript: Australian farmers have a responsibility to control dingoes, or wild dogs, that are running on their property. So about three years ago, I made a decision to change my strategy about controlling wild dogs on my property and decided to go and look for the young at brooding time, which was July. The dingoes have their pups in July. And I was lucky enough to find two litters, and having reared a couple of those dingoes, I got to the understanding that I could probably try a policy of having my own dingo pack and regularly walk them around my property and might be able to control the other of the wild dingo pack by letting them know there was already a pack of dogs in this area. The culmination of my efforts through removing these pups from the hollow logs means that now I have mature dingoes, who are now brooding age, and just only a few nights ago I was very privileged to be present for the birth of my own. I'm right up close and it's all happening just natural like a wood in the bush, except the dingo doesn't have a fear of me and accepts me in. I just feel so privileged to be able to be right up close to something that is normally so secretive. An interesting characteristic I found with dingoes, they don't normally bark, but they have a whole heap of other noises they make in communication, quiet communications, and they do a very throaty, I think a dingo could almost talk. Come up here baby. Yes I will. My lovely dingo baby. Go on. And I learned early on sitting here by the campfire, when I had dingo pups beside me, that when I played the harmonica, they all went into howl. I don't really know whether they think I'm sad or what it is with the harmonica that really gets into them, but all they want to do is come and sit beside me and howl with me. I feed my dingoes a variety of foods. I like to get a big boiler, half fill it with water, put in vegetables. I try to give them as much native food that they would naturally have got themselves. You can't always count on a roadkill kangaroo or something coming along when you need it. They all seem quite happy. I think they do well on it as a matter of fact. I feel privileged to have actually seen what happens with dingoes right up close. They're so misunderstood in Australia. I really realise how much they have accepted me as I'm just one of a number. And I have some very good traits. All dingoes have their part in the pack. I suppose one of my best traits must be they consider me a good cook. Baa! Eee! No!

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Wolves delisted Again 3/06/2009 URGENT Photos courtesy of  those of you who are unaware of this, the new Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar has delisted the wolves in Western Great Lakes and the Rocky Mountain states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Utah as of March 6th, 2009.  Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5. Mention any of the information that I wrote about above or anything I may have forgotten.Remember, please be polite but state your case.  This is the only chance we have and time is ticking away.  Please share this video with all of your animal loving friends and MAKE THAT CALL ASAP.Is this the change that the majority of Americans voted for in November?\nTranscript: you you you you you you you you you you\nComment: Slideshow???

The bucks are the ones with the brown on their heads - the brown is staining from tree bark as they rub their antlers on trees.  They will be snow white again when they shed their winter coats.  They are not regulars in our neck of the woods so we didn't have the opportunity to see them with their antlers.  We sure would have loved to.  We did get a brief glimpse of the old buck with his wide, palmated antlers.  It seems that as the albino bucks age their antlers get thicker & thicker.  We learned shortly after this filming that the old buck (with the limp) was taken by wolves.  They only came around a few days but we sure enjoyed seeing them.  The big buck especially, who we called Big Al, was absolutely magnificent.  So far we haven't had a glimpse of the two remaining bucks this winter.\nTranscript: ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪\nComment: So beautiful!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: Yeh it was just a freak thing that happened, never happend before or since.  Thanks for watching."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets. A female red fox is known as a vixen, and a male red fox is known as a dog fox; a fox baby is known as a kit or cub.\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: great stuff, nicely done "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

How do you know? It hasn't moved. That's real. Let's get away from here. What are you so afraid of? It could turn around and come right up here. What are you kidding? It's just a little one. I don't care how little it is. It could only bite your foot. Little ones don't eat? It could only lose a toe. Do you think that's real? Yeah. So did we see a crocodile or an alligator? It wasn't out. I didn't know there was a whale. It's got a strap. For photos, on the second half of the tour of that bird, they're going to be standing right next to you. Okay? I've never been in any place where you could get this close to great blue herons, and I've never seen... The wildlife in the Everglades don't play by the rules, because water is life. Whatever God gives us for that amount of water of the year, they have. Whether you're dangerous or not, we don't want to appear dangerous. This is a mother alligator. How many people are seeing an alligator in the wild for the first time today? Okay. I've got three questions for you, and we're going to have a quiz at the top. What color are alligators? I didn't ask you. You better tell me later. Oh, see, she's tired of me already. Oh, she's okay. Oh, she's big enough to be a monitor. They start off maybe four or five feet long. Yeah, the babies are on the grass behind the mothers. I think that might be a baby gator. The baby gators are on the grass behind you? Yeah. Are you a mama? Well, obviously that has to be a female. Well, if it was a male, there weren't any babies in there. They'd be in his tummy. Well, I can tell you how you wouldn't need to find out for sure if you wanted to want to. Anyway, mama and one little baby on the pipe. Oh, there's two babies. They're like right across from each other. It's like stereo babies. Stereo baby gators. Very relaxed because we've had a long, very hot, very dry rainy season. And the other years we were very stressed out. Yep, it's the babies. Two of them. All right, now let's turn it up. The babies are quiet. See? The babies are quiet. She's backing up three babies. We're just going to roll them by real slow. She's not real happy. See how protected she is? Unlike most reptiles, turtles or whatever that lay their eggs and then go back in the water. That's in a motherhood. Now a gator is more like a panther in the way the female protects her babies. And she will protect her babies not only from birds and otters or whatever is coming after them. She will have to protect her babies from turtles. Come back. Relax. We're at the tower here at Shark Island. I'm going to zoom in. Just laying on the grass there. Yeah. Is this another little one over here? Yeah. Push it. Is that another little one right here? That thing's a monster. It's crazy. Push it. Okay, we're heading to the tower at Shark Island. We just saw a whole bunch of alligators. Probably about six. And they were mothers with babies. And we're just walking to the tower right now. The tower is right there. We're going to be standing at the top there and looking around. You can see around 360 degrees. Are you going to make it? Yeah. I think she'll make it. I haven't got shoes on. Just get her good shoes on. We're walking up this circular path and you can see it goes all the way around to the tower. There's frickin' alligators everywhere. You notice here? That's the only remains of the guy that fell off this bridge. Just his hat. And there's the gator. There's the gator that ate the guy.

You can nearly touch them.\nTranscript: So we're going to be taking Georgie and Yami a walk. Let's go. Yeah. Time for a drive. And it's an enrichment walk. We do this with all the lions. It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back. There we go. There we go. Don't say I don't love you. So I hope you enjoyed your walk with Georgie and Yami.

And home to the Saltwater Crocodile. Abundant cattle and birdlife can be seen along its shores. And this provides an excellent food source for the Saltwater Crocodile. Crocodiles in this area are some of the largest seen anywhere in the world. With an estimated 20 crocodiles per kilometre of river, this truly is the land of the giants. Fights break out often in the crocodile world, usually for the best spot. Here it is in slow motion. Watch for the snap. Bam! Of course I went there to see the giant crocodiles. Here is a normal sized croc. And here is Maximus. Estimated to be between 6 and 7 metres in length. As you can imagine, he is very good at intimidating his rivals. He is rarely seen on the bank, probably because of his massive size. This area of the Ord River is adjacent to many cattle properties. Seen here is a helicopter doing a survey, possibly checking how many of their cattle are still alive. Often crocodiles are seen grouped together. Here you can see four crocodiles hanging around in the one spot. Recently a local cattle station reported that they lose one to two cows per day to crocodile attacks. And with the sheer numbers of crocodiles I have seen in this area, I have no doubt. This has been Jeremy Rook, crocstalker.com. Thanks for watching. Please subscribe to my channel.

Up backpacking with the kids and brother-in-laws Uncle Bingo and I had a close encounter with a Bull Moose. Returning to the car to gather extra gear for the kids at dusk, turned a bend on the trail and a bull moose was not too far off. I was in his comfort zone and he let me know it. Some very raw footage and just a snapshot of the trip. Also, Bingo and I having some fun talking about the youtube series \"Guy on a Buffalo.\" Personally I find it funny.Please visit \nTranscript: Let me set up this video for you. So I went backpacking, well, if you want to call it backpacking, with my kids, my brother-in-laws and their kids. Because we had so many young kids with us, we actually didn't go in very far at all. But we went in, found a spot, dropped all our stuff, and some of the adults stayed with the kids, and me and Uncle Bingo, actually, you've seen him in my films before, we went back down to the car to get the rest of the sleeping bags and that kind of stuff. But what happened is, I actually went down first. I kind of bushwhacked a little bit, you guys know how I like that, and then I hooked up with a trail later, and I was just, oh, I don't know, probably 50 yards ahead of him. And as I'm walking down, I'm almost to the street, and I notice a car was parked on the street right where our cars were parked, and it was just sitting there. I'm thinking, what is that car doing? As I walk and I come around this tree, I look over and there's a nice big old bull moose. And he's, well, he's not huge, but he's sitting there and he sees me come around the corner, he stops and he looks at me. And then my brother-in-law, Uncle Bingo, starts coming behind me, and I tell him to kind of be quiet because I want to get some film of this guy, and I kind of wave him over. But one thing I always talk about is looking for body language, and you're going to see it in this one. One of the signs of aggression that moose exhibit when you are in their space is they will often lower their heads, their ears will lay back on their heads. And then this guy, he started a beeline right at me. Now, what to look for here is, the first thing I did when I saw him, I thought, yeah, we're kind of close, but I'll be honest, you get a camera in my hand and all I'm thinking about is getting a shot. So I get my camera out, and when he starts coming at me, I'll edit this so it's kid-friendly. But I actually switched the camera to my left hand so that I could get my Glock 27 out of my ribs pack with my right, but it was just very sloppy because I'm trying to film him and I'm trying to get my gun out and I'm trying to watch him all at the same time. And anyway, I'll have you take a look at this, it's kind of fun. So of course, this is when I first see him. I get the camera right out of the pack. He hasn't seen me yet, but then he turns right here, bam, he sees me. Now it doesn't take him long, lower his head, see him lower his ears. Now, at this point, for some reason, I go into a weird accent and I'm trying to fish my Glock 27 out. Although I do have some good footage of you. Not really because it's so shaky. I think we're just kind of right in his way, there he goes, he's alright. Now what ensues here is me and Uncle Bingo just really enjoying the experience and talking about it, and it's very raw footage guys, it's just kind of a snapshot of this trip and a very unpolished snapshot of that. Is there two of them? Oh yeah, there is. Is it a bull or is it a cow? The thing is, is we're getting into rut season. And that means they get pretty ornery. Not quite though, but close. Looks like they're just doing their thing, I love this man, jeez. Good thing you stopped me, I came charging down the trail, making all kinds of sounds to scare bears, but. Uncle Bingo of course. You would have just took me out. I mean the cars are just right there, that's where the road is. And the bull moose and what we think is a cow. And we're pretty dang close to that bull moose right now. Let's see if I can... He's just right there, he's watching us. He's okay. He's alright. They really blend in if you're not watching. Yeah, they do don't they? As big as they are. Okay, this is what we're going to do. I'm going to film you. You run up, slap his butt, or spray paint it, and run as fast as you can. I'll tape the whole thing, this will be great YouTube footage. This will be like missing the Sasquatch a little bit. Okay, I'm in. Okay. We just forced him in the brush. Now see, I can't tell if he's eating or maybe... Look at this, maybe this is his bed. He's like, hey buddy. Get away from my bed. This is about as close as I dare get. We're probably 20 feet apart with a lot of brush in between us. He seems pretty calm. He's just gone about his business eating again. That's one thing I do, is really watch their body language. And understand where you are too. I know a lot of you guys tell me... I've had several guys in Alaska tell me, you could never do this. In Alaska with the moose that they have. Sorry guys, I'm not filming too well right now. I'm more watching him than trying to film him. Hey look, there's a baby. Awesome. Put him in your pack. What? Got straight up mauled by a cougar. Got on a buffalo. Buffalo sounds. We're approaching moose territory again. And this is our strategy. We've got plenty of sleeping bags. So if he charges us, we use the sleeping bag as a shield, punch him, wrestle him down, hog tie him. Good to go. I could do a drop kick to knock him over. That would be cool. We need to set up the camera though, so we can get it all on tape. Where's your action camera? Do you see that one? The bear one? That's freaking hilarious. He's right there, hanging out. He's the guy in the hat with the cool hat. Knock your hat, but it's not going to save you. Where he knocks the stove over. Knock the stove over on your foot.

I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone.

You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not. But kind of like a\nComment: Okay; to the ones crying bloody murder, the hyenas are probably fine. The visitors probably expected to hear them 'laughing', so not having them laugh is a poor show on the handler's part. Unlike what you think, the hyenas don't pay a nightly fee to stay in the park: it is paid for by visitors, who will also recommend the park to friends or take others along."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

A new foal is trying to stand for the first time. Try as it will, the little foal's back legs just don't seem to work. The mare guards it from her curious two-year-old son. As the hours pass, I realize something's wrong. Even the band's stallion, Boomer, tries to encourage the foal. That's when another band moves into the meadow, led by the husky stallion, Looking Glass. Boomer's little band moves away. And the foal tries, but cannot follow. Looking Glass's lead mare notices something in the grass. She's joined by a second mare and a young stallion. She seems to encourage the foal, while Boomer's band looks on. Then Looking Glass approaches. And I was shocked at what happened next. The mares try to stop him. Boomer charges in, but it's too late. I tell myself the stallion did the foal a favor, saving it from a lingering death. But Looking Glass's aggression is disturbing and haunting.\nComment: A lot of foals in the wild die this way actually... Stallions will kill foals who aren't fit to survive.\n\nAt the same time, though... If the foal is fit and healthy, stallions will keep the colt in the herd, even if it's not their own. They're not like cats who kill babies in cold blood as soon as they realize it's not their own, but they do it to keep the herd together and safe. Mares would destroy the herd to stay with a dying foal if they had the chance. The stallion was doing the herd a favor and the foal one so predators wouldn't come and kill it. Or if it lasted that long, die of starvation or disease.\n\n\nHorses don't get \"jealous\" they have a smaller mindset and emotion span than humans do. The major instinct of a stallion, who runs the herd, btw... The lead mare guides them, but if a stallion wants to stop her, he does and makes the herd go in a different direction. Just most of the time he doesn't and protects the herd from behind, including adopting foals and colts under 2 into the herd themselves. They want to keep the herd large, they want to have as many eyes as possible and as many foals as possible even if they're not their own. Watch stallions interact with foals that aren't their own, even in the wild, they will act like it's their own. Predators kill off other males young mainly because they're at the top of the food chain, they get their genes spread faster. Hell, in some cases the males aren't even ALLOWED to kill the young because there's enough females to interfere. The non-pregnant females actually battle the pregnant/females caring for cubs for the chance of the babies of surviving in prides even if it's not the males cubs. But this allows new blood into the group for predators. For prey it lessens the chance of the herd/species surviving."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Our mission for this outing was to focus on animals that tend to converge near watering holes; however, on the drive over the first animal we spotted was the ever elusive leopard. It literally walked right out in front of our Land Rover, and our guide Lloyd was even more excited than us. As the day progressed we witnessed plenty of fascinating events at random watering holes. Impalas, wildebeests and buffalo drinking with crocodiles lurking dangerously submerged under the water. In another section Hippos lazily bathing in mud and a monitor lizard slinking across a barren stretch of land. It was another very eventful safari and we ended up spotting all of 'The Big 5' with mere minutes left on tour with an intimate encounter with a Rhino to close things off.

On 08.03.08, this storm hit the US midsection during a year which already had bad storms. The storm is shown in another video, Great Blizzard 2008, Record Breaking, Storm of Century,  video was made one day afterwards. The wildlife were getting hungry. Here two doe and two fawns come up to the bird feeder (they generally inspect it after dark). Although they were very hungry, they were even more curious about the cat. Deer do not appear to understand what domestic animals are and are exceedingly curious.The cat was curious also. The deer kept their distance, but spent some time looking over the cat. One fawn seemed to not be in the best of a mood. It hit its mother with a hoof at least twice (at ~ .46 and 1.2).The deer kept getting closer to the cat by hiding behind the snow drift, then going back to the tree. The snow was so deep that the deer could hardly run through it, when they left.The previous Video begins with view of field and trees taken immediately (~1-2 days) before the storm. Wildlife includes whitetail deer (which are loosing their antlers), wild turkeys, turkey vultures (sighted here for first time of year), and crows. Video then shows blizzard beginning at night. Nighttime animals out included raccoons (only 1 was photographed) and a coyote. These animals were videotaped in infrared. The  storm was getting bad during the coyote filming. Video then shows view of the storm. Only the closest trees were visible during the whiteout, as compared to the normal view of the area. Small snow whirlwinds, tornados, and gusts traveled across the landscape. Snow was cleared here with backhoe.The record breaking snow fall was 20.4 inches. The previous mark in Ohio for snow during 1 storm was 15.3 inches. And this record was made in 1910. Blizzard was compared to the famous blizzard of 1978. Streets were closed, a snow emergency was declared, and plane travel stopped (although I heard a jet while I was filming the coyote). A level 3 snow emergency was declared in many counties. Freeways were closed. Cities had parking bans. Contingents of several snow plows pulled through, some slid off the road. Many accidents occurred. People intending to vacation in warm places were stuck in Ohio.After the storm traffic was still stopped. The streets were used for sledding and snowboarding.Additional views of wild deer on the farm include:LARGE BUCK FIGHT-LOCK ANTLERS, ENTANGLED, CLOSE WHITETAIL  Non-Typical Moose-Sized Buck DEER - ACTION SHOTS RARE WHITE WILD WHITETAIL BUCK  views of this white deer: white deer on the farm -- the banded one & sibling: white deer being stalked by coyotes: strange deer on the farm deer fighting bucks run and jump bucks fighting COYOTES VS.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Top 3 Most Memorable Wild Animal Experiences Spawned from a viewer comment, I discuss 2 (actually 3) of my most memorable animal experiences while in the backcountry. And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: That strange voice is called not wanting a confrontation. :) Cool video."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Flavio is a beautiful animal.

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back.

Alright, so Scott drops us off at this property and this pasture he puts us in front of is absolutely huge. It has to be 2,000 acres and he pointed out this corral way out in the middle, he said just go sit there. These dogs like to run these guts, these ravines and so Andy and I made our way out there and we started making ourselves a little blind, took some old logs, stacking them up. I go to put the mojo out and I come back, Andy's glassed in the field, he says stop what you're doing, I think I see a coyote. Sure enough, we look out, there's two little earsy spots and I just sit down and enough time for this dog to stand up, we lay on the calls and this dog comes sprinting in. Alright, ready? I'm ready.

These forests are home to diverse fauna and flora, many of them showing affinities to the Malayan region, but are increasingly threatened by human activity. Several national parks and other protected areas lie within the range, but it is estimated that only a small fraction of the Western Ghats remains in pristine condition. The Silent Valley National Park in Kerala is considered by many to be the last tracts of virgin tropical evergreen forest in India.Biogeographers have long recognized the distinctive plant and animal communities of the Western Ghats. Many of these faunal and floral elements are not found anywhere else in India except in parts of northeastern India.

How many people are seeing an alligator in the wild for the first time today? Okay. I've got three questions for you, and we're going to have a quiz at the top. What color are alligators? I didn't ask you. You better tell me later. Oh, see, she's tired of me already. Oh, she's okay. Oh, she's big enough to be a monitor. They start off maybe four or five feet long. Yeah, the babies are on the grass behind the mothers. I think that might be a baby gator. The baby gators are on the grass behind you? Yeah. Are you a mama? Well, obviously that has to be a female. Well, if it was a male, there weren't any babies in there. They'd be in his tummy. Well, I can tell you how you wouldn't need to find out for sure if you wanted to want to. Anyway, mama and one little baby on the pipe. Oh, there's two babies. They're like right across from each other. It's like stereo babies. Stereo baby gators. Very relaxed because we've had a long, very hot, very dry rainy season. And the other years we were very stressed out. Yep, it's the babies. Two of them. All right, now let's turn it up. The babies are quiet. See? The babies are quiet. She's backing up three babies. We're just going to roll them by real slow. She's not real happy. See how protected she is? Unlike most reptiles, turtles or whatever that lay their eggs and then go back in the water. That's in a motherhood. Now a gator is more like a panther in the way the female protects her babies. And she will protect her babies not only from birds and otters or whatever is coming after them. She will have to protect her babies from turtles. Come back. Relax. We're at the tower here at Shark Island. I'm going to zoom in. Just laying on the grass there. Yeah. Is this another little one over here? Yeah. Push it. Is that another little one right here? That thing's a monster. It's crazy. Push it. Okay, we're heading to the tower at Shark Island. We just saw a whole bunch of alligators. Probably about six. And they were mothers with babies. And we're just walking to the tower right now. The tower is right there. We're going to be standing at the top there and looking around. You can see around 360 degrees. Are you going to make it? Yeah. I think she'll make it. I haven't got shoes on. Just get her good shoes on. We're walking up this circular path and you can see it goes all the way around to the tower.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over.

Comprehensive plans for bears were formulated in 1990 (grizzlies) and 1993 (black bears).\n\nGenerally, the plan concluded that Alberta's population was healthy and in no danger of overexploitation. The objectives emphasized that the current population should be maintained, that hunting harvests for Albertans and non-residents could be locally increased, that more nuisance bears be translocated, and that research be continued.\n Where populations are adequate, high-quality recreational hunting could be encouraged particularly in areas where it might contribute to a reduction in the incidence of problems.

She's got a baby in her mouth. Look at that. It's not something you get to see every day. Mama squirrel has a baby. She's just taking it with her. I just ran inside to get the camera so I could get this. Oh, there's a nest right above my head there. There's one up there already. So now I know she has two babies. And I guess she decided that that nest is a better place than the box. And I have a feeling why. I wasn't leaving her alone. I put a bowl of food up there thinking I was doing her a favor. But now I realize that she doesn't want her babies near food. Because the food not only doesn't draw other squirrels, which would be a problem, but it draws other animals. So I made a mistake. I basically kicked her out of the nest box by giving her some food. So I learned something. She has another baby in her mouth right there. I don't know if it's on camera, but I can see it and I don't know where she's going with it. Oh, there's another nest. Look at that. She's just nest hopping with her babies. That's interesting. Well, so far I've seen two babies. That's one. And here she goes. Where did she go? Where'd you go, Mama Bear? There you are. Interesting. Oh, no, she's got a baby again. Look at that. She's trying out different nests. That is the craziest thing. I have never seen a squirrel moving a baby. There she is. She's going back. She's moving it back now. I don't believe it. She's putting it back. And it's just in her mouth and it's not crying or screaming or anything. Now she's putting it back. I don't believe it. I guess the nests weren't good enough. Okay. So now there's one baby back in the wooden box. I suspect she's going to come back here and grab the second one. That is crazy. Here she comes. She just popped out of the box and she's going to come back to where I am and grab the other baby. I know this because I saw her bring it over here. Hey, mama. Now she's going to go up to that nest straight up and get a baby. And I am going to show. Wouldn't it be interesting if these babies were nibblers? Obviously, there's no way to tell such a thing, but that would be cool. There she is. She's at the nest now. I can't tell because I'm looking straight up. I can't tell if the camera can see this. Okay, she's grabbed the baby. And it's in her mouth. Alright, here she comes. Oh my gosh, she's right in front of me. Hey sweetie, it's okay. Go on. Oh, and the baby's just hanging there. Oh, it's so cute. That is so cute. Alright, two babies safe in the box. I'll remember next time. I'm not going to put food up there anymore. Hopefully she keeps them there. Maybe I can tame up another pair of squirrels. That would be so neat.\nComment: what you need to learn, buddy, is to get out of the way. They can smell you even if they can't see you. Try to be more discreet., please. You're scaring the hell out of the poor little creatures."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

And home to the Saltwater Crocodile. Abundant cattle and birdlife can be seen along its shores. And this provides an excellent food source for the Saltwater Crocodile. Crocodiles in this area are some of the largest seen anywhere in the world. With an estimated 20 crocodiles per kilometre of river, this truly is the land of the giants. Fights break out often in the crocodile world, usually for the best spot. Here it is in slow motion. Watch for the snap. Bam! Of course I went there to see the giant crocodiles. Here is a normal sized croc. And here is Maximus. Estimated to be between 6 and 7 metres in length. As you can imagine, he is very good at intimidating his rivals. He is rarely seen on the bank, probably because of his massive size. This area of the Ord River is adjacent to many cattle properties. Seen here is a helicopter doing a survey, possibly checking how many of their cattle are still alive. Often crocodiles are seen grouped together. Here you can see four crocodiles hanging around in the one spot. Recently a local cattle station reported that they lose one to two cows per day to crocodile attacks. And with the sheer numbers of crocodiles I have seen in this area, I have no doubt. This has been Jeremy Rook, crocstalker.com. Thanks for watching. Please subscribe to my channel.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: What's wrong with people. We should stop with white tiger breeding and save the real tigers! Not a modified tiger which lives in pain all its life from inbreeding!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: Thank you."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The 800,000-acre Twin Peaks Herd Management Area lies along the California-Nevada border northeast of Susanville.\nTranscript: Hi, I'm standing in the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area in Northern California. This is the largest wild horse and burrow management area in BLM California. This summer we're planning a gather to bring in excess horses and burrows because we have too many on the range right now and it's not healthy for either the horses, the burrows or the range that they live on. We manage for a lot of uses out here. Horses and burrows are one of them, as well as cattle and public recreation. So it's important to make sure that we balance all of these uses and make sure that we're taking care of the land we're charged to manage. Today we're going to take you around and show you some of the herd management area. We'll show you some of the areas where the horses and the burrows like to live, where they range, what they eat. We might even be able to see horses and burrows today, that's our plan. Straddling the Nevada-California border about 120 miles north of Reno, Nevada, this rugged high desert landscape provides important habitat for wild horses and burrows and wildlife. It also provides forage for domestic livestock grazing that is an important part of local economies. The appropriate management level for the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area is 448 to 758 wild horses and 72 to 116 wild burrows. The current populations are estimated at 2,300 wild horses, about five times the appropriate management level, and 280 wild burrows, about two times the appropriate management level. At almost 800,000 acres, the region is vast, but its resources limited. In fact, many parts of this rugged-looking landscape are fragile and require careful management. We're standing here on the edge of the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area. I wanted to show you the perennial grasses that are out here and explain a little bit as to why they're important. So before me is some crested wheatgrass and you'll see that it's critical. It's good forage for wild horses and burrows. It also serves as thermal cover for a lot of the smaller species that we have, birds and lizards and things like that. It serves also a purpose of keeping the soil in place. It helps to bind the soil particles together through the root system and also shield the soil particles from raindrop impact. In this part of the HMA, things are higher in elevation, so we end up with more production. These perennial grasses that you see behind me are plentiful and can provide more forage per acre, whereas other parts of the HMA are lower elevation and you end up with approximately 30 acres per one horse a month. We'll show you that a little later when we get to one of those spots. So here we are in the lower elevation area of the Twin Peaks HMA, and while it certainly is beautiful, looks can be deceiving. This area here would take about 30 football fields, or 30 acres, to support one horse per month. It comes out to be a lot of country when you consider we want about 500 horses in the HMA. There are other uses out here as well, such as pronghorn, mule deer, and permitted livestock grazing. The horses and burros are healthy, and much of the range appears to be healthy as well. A closer look, however, reveals that some areas are showing signs of stress, requiring management actions, including reducing the wild horse herd. Limited water and the need to keep water sources healthy are the primary management concerns in Twin Peaks. So we're at Painter Creek now, and this is an area that we would call functioning at risk during our riparian assessments. Some of the indicators here as to why things are not properly functioning. You can see the slough banks here. This is due to trampling from livestock and horses when they come down in. If the right type of riparian vegetation isn't here, and the root system isn't stable enough to hold the soil in place, you'll actually get it sloughing off, destabilizing the banks, and then also causing a decrease in water quality. So there are several reasons why we want to keep riparian areas from becoming this degraded, and why we want to see them in proper functioning condition and not functioning at risk. That includes for the health of the wildlife that use the area, as well as the health of the Twin Peaks horse herd. It's important to keep this water system available and functioning year-round, since water is such a limiting factor in these arid environments. So this is an example of a properly functioning riparian area. Some of the indicators that you would look for would be riparian species covering the banks, which is what you see here, aquatic vegetation throughout the stream channel, clear water that can support wildlife, such as the fish and the minnows that you see in the creek behind us, as well as stabilized makes. Visited during spring, much of the Twin Peaks area appears vibrant and green, but this situation changes over the course of the summer. Hot weather and the lack of rain reduce the amount of forage available for range animals, including wild horses and burros. To keep ranges healthy, the BLM must balance uses at sustainable levels. Livestock are managed in specific areas and allowed on the range for designated grazing seasons. In response to resource conditions, the BLM and ranchers have reduced livestock numbers by about 50% compared to 30 years ago. Wild horses and burros use the range all year, therefore, herd populations must be maintained at sustainable levels. Balancing uses is part of the BLM's multiple-use mandate and responsibility on the public lands. Wild horses are an integral part and an important part of that diversity that's found out on the ranges. However, if their numbers are allowed to increase without management, then eventually it will come to damage not only the resources and the other uses on the ranges, but the wild horses themselves. Twin Peaks has always had the ability to carry some horses. When numbers get very, very high, you can really run into problems. What in effect happens is that more animals end up being at risk and there can be a set up for catastrophic losses, either from a long-term drought or heavy snow. You know, we're proud of the fact that we have healthy wild horses and burros on the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area. It's important to us to be proactive and make sure that we keep the horses and burros within an appropriate management level. Therefore, we come out and every few years we have to remove the excess horses and burros, and that helps us ensure that the horses and burros remain healthy, as well as the rangelands that they like to roam on. The wild horses and burros that we remove off the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area all go to good homes. Some of them are adopted out, they're very popular for their size and their health, and some of them go to long-term pastures. It's important to BLM that these wild horses and burros do end up in good homes or in the long-term pastures where they can spend the rest of their lives. As public land managers, our job is to manage wild horses and burros on the range, to keep both the horses and burros healthy, as well as the rangelands. And we welcome and encourage your involvement in that work. It takes all of us together to make sure that we're doing the right thing by the horses and the burros and the land.\nComment: Who says that cattle  ( a commerce business that is otherwise raised on land owned by the person making money off the cattle) are more important? then wild horses?

These forests are home to diverse fauna and flora, many of them showing affinities to the Malayan region, but are increasingly threatened by human activity. Several national parks and other protected areas lie within the range, but it is estimated that only a small fraction of the Western Ghats remains in pristine condition. The Silent Valley National Park in Kerala is considered by many to be the last tracts of virgin tropical evergreen forest in India.Biogeographers have long recognized the distinctive plant and animal communities of the Western Ghats. Many of these faunal and floral elements are not found anywhere else in India except in parts of northeastern India. The Western Ghats are also home to many endemic species, and the endemism is especially high in the amphibian and reptilian fauna.\nTranscript: so so so so so ah uh so hmm so so so so so so so\nComment: It was really a awesome BT very sad to see the dead animals in nights on the road . so please first try to save animals.

There's baby number four just getting ready. There's the fourth one. It came out and landed on the ground. I'm going to stay here so the cat doesn't get it. That's one chickadee that just about got ate. Apologize for the sound of the lawnmower, but it's pretty neat. Four baby chickadees. This is like the true survival story right here. All these birds never make it because there's just too many cats around here. This is kind of a messed up situation. I'm about four foot away from this bird and I want to leave them alone so that they can go about their natural way, but as soon as I leave, that cat is going to come and eat this bird. It'll get ate if it doesn't get its flying wings. There's their nest in the lower right hand of the screen. I left that one alone.

The cats' efforts were captured by high-definition and slow-motion cameras for the Saving a Species series for teachers.Subscribe to our channel on YouTube:  to our print magazine:  our Blog:  us on Twitter:  a fan on Facebook:  our TV show: \nTranscript: Today we're shooting an episode of Shamu TV. It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection. It's just something that we've been doing for a long time. We're very passionate about our care for animals and we want to share that with everyone.\nComment: I want to see one running FULL SPEED.

I guess, I never showed you guys that at the other campground. Anyway, this is a nice campground. And look, grass, not dirt. The campground that we stayed at last weekend, it was all dirt. Every single campsite was dirt. Which is just crazy. So, we're getting ready to head on the road. Head on the road. We're gonna head on the road? Head on the road. Whatever. So, we just left the campground and we are headed to Oswald's Bear Ranch. They have the north, I think the largest collection of black bears, is it? Probably. Largest collection of black bears in the United States. Or at least like on this side of the United States. Cause we were at a black bear ranch one time out west and they had a lot of bears too. I think they had a large collection of bears though, not just black bears. Yeah, I think they had like grizzly bears. Yeah, they had a Kodiak. I remember that. And this guy just has just black bears. So, we're gonna go see some bears. Not you girls. You girls are gonna have to sit in the car with the air conditioner on for a little bit. That's why we have two sets of keys. We're at the bear ranch. There's their dens. And way back there we see a bear. These are the female bears, I believe. There's a big bear right there. Just a walking. They just remind me of dogs. Imagine what it sounds like when they get all playing. Yeah. Probably like Shelby and Oakley. Yeah. Look a bear, panting just like the dogs. We don't have any apples. We didn't buy any apples yet. And don't look like he needs many apples. Pretty cool. What's up dude? What's up? Are you hot? I think these are the females he said. Yeah, and she looks like she could be pregnant. No, they're getting ready for hibernation, Jamie. Oh, that's right. Man, looks like an apple. There's that one sleeping under a tree. There's another one walking down here. I think they said there's seven in this enclosure. They have 29 all together here. Look, another bear. This one just sat down to stare at Rebecca. What do you think, Rebecca? You ever been that close to a bear? No. What are you doing, huh? Just chilling out in there? Just chilling out. She's a little smaller than the last one. Yeah, she is. Oh, look at this one.

Look how little she is. She's just a-walking. Looking for food. Here she goes. Looking away. Looking away. She makes a loop. And eyes. Boom. She's looking for an apple. Yeah, she wants to make sure it's not up here. Let's keep walking. We'll go find more. There's lots more. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one here's sitting up. He's like, Oh, but I wanted an apple. Those people are feeding the bears apples. So they're going to follow them all the way around. They're going to try to anyway. Uh-huh. This one's playing in the water. Didn't think he was going to. Look. King of the mountain. Yep, always balancing. He's going to lay right down in the water. Oh, I bet that feels good. That's funny. Both of them are like, Slowly going. How cool is that? So, where are we? The bear pen. Oswald, the bear pen. Bear pen. Oswald's bear ranch. In Newberry. In Newberry. Yep. Got Rebecca.

What's up, huh? Oh, you gotta get up, huh? Gotta move. No, you can stay. No, that one's yawning. I'm tired too. We're leaving. I hit the camera. We're leaving Oswald's Bear Ranch and now we're heading down to Newberry. That was pretty cool. If you're ever up here and you're thinking about whether or not you should stop, you should stop. Cause I had fun. Did you have fun? I had fun. Did you have fun, Rebecca? Yes, I had fun. And the dogs did well sitting in the car. We didn't leave them for too long. So, on to Newberry, I guess. It was neat to see all the bears playing. Yeah, we got some cool video we'll show you guys. And I guess if you're gonna go, you gotta go early in the morning while they're out moving around. Yeah, cause once it gets hot, they're not... They don't like to be out. Why are you in my face? Put in my face. Jamie's outside putting air in the camper tires and the Jeep tires. We got one dog. We got two dogs. We got all three dogs. There's camper. Can't see it cause the window's really dirty. There's Jamie. He just put air in the tires.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: Save my species."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Good point, good point, Flavio is definitely all man! :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Video Evidence of Taxpayer Dollars Wasted on Everglades Bridging & Water Pollution Killing Wildlife The news stations and public have been misinformed about the water flowing south through the new 81 to 100 million dollar one mile bridge. The fact is that not a drop has been let through as of yet; the water is too polluted according to National Park regulations to run it south through the National Park. The question is if the water is flowed south will it be able to flow through the National Park the majority of the year? Now a 2.6 mile bridge is in sight, and additional 2.9 miles of bridging to proceed it. The problem we see is that the first 1 mile bridge has not yet been tested. The truth to the whole matter is, the Everglades biggest problem lies up north with pollution that should be corrected before spending taxpayers money on a science project that will be a permeant costly disaster if it does not work.We have studied the water flow patterns through the existing culverts for many decades. We have seen how the wildlife has been affected and have analyzed the situation as a whole. The ecosystem and wildlife is disappearing and suffering. Wildlife is becoming smaller in size, becoming weaker, and natural life spans are getting shorter. In 1998 a florida panther was found dead in Everglades Shark River Slough with levels of mercury so high it could kill an adult human.Right now and for the past several months before the 81 to 100 million dollar bridge was even finished water has actually been flowing through the National Park from south to north through the existing culverts; yes, backwards because the water is too polluted. Everyday a test by one of us has been conducted on the bridge to test the direction of the water flow. A hand full of sand is dropped at the opening, but it sinks straight to the bottom. If the flow of water was flowing south the sand would visibly be carried in that direction. Imagine 2.6 miles of water flowing backwards, (yes north) verses the culverts that are in place now. That equals a lot more water traveling north because water pollution regulations do not permit them to flow south through the National Park. Also sending water south would require permission from the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, which owns lands south of Lake Okeechobee and north of Everglades National Park. The Miccosukee Tribe is against the polluted waters being flowed into their land, and they are taking action to preserve their way of life. They would not be able to survive if the water and food is all poisoned. According to Earth Justice the pumps for polluted water on average contribute the equivalent of 60,000 one hundred pound bag of phosphorus to Lake Okeechobee each year.If the bridging is in place unnatural water depths will follow unnatural hydro-periods and water flow patterns. Now all the wildlife's hammocks will be under water, and there will be no dry land. This will result in unhealthy conditions. More water, more water, more water, is not the answer; Clean water, clean water, clean water, is the answer! Because of being in a hurry to build all these bridges that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars are we really going to sacrifice one environment to stop salt water intrusion down south into the bay? Remember there's only one Everglades and its all connected. All these bridges do not save the Everglades, they flood and pollute them more then they already are. We are affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. We have to treat the source of infection instead of covering it up with a bandaid.\nTranscript: Here we are west of the 2.6 mile bridge proposed area at the S333 lock. Water is not flowing into the Tamiami Trail Canal, the lock is closed. Here we are south of that lock. The water is traveling from the west to the east in the canal south of Tamiami Trail. These overflow pipes were located in this area and removed. When water levels would reach the height of the top of the pipe would flow into the pipe. They would act as an overflow and then flow water south into the canal, flowing the water into the National Park. The water now is flowing at a much more rapid rate into the National Park. The problem is it is making a U-turn and finding the path of least resistance due to sawgrass and a southern ridge. It is making a U-turn and flowing north instead of south. The opposite of what it is supposed to do. As the water flows north it travels through these pipes, culverts that flow into the Tamiami Trail Canal. This area is the center of the 2.6 mile proposed bridge. A bridge located here instead of the culverts would flow way more water north, completely drying out the south. You can see the rapid flow rate with three culverts. Imagine a bridge drying out and creating an unnatural drought south of the Tamiami Trail, interrupting the natural process of this part of the Everglades. Wildlife would suffer. Wildlife has already suffered enough due to over 25 years of held water in these areas and too much water and now more water is proposed, over 2 feet more in the canal. As of right now the National Park does not flow water south due to over 10 parts per billion of water pollution regulations. They have not been able to flow water south even through the one mile bridge. Here you can see water rapidly flowing north through these culverts, the area and center of this 2.6 mile bridge. This is not where the bridge should be located. During droughts this area has always flowed water north. Instead of here, the S3334 locks, when opened, create a suction that even increases drastically the water flow north from the south side, drying up the area even faster. Look at the flow going north into the Tamiami Trail Canal. The Everglades does not travel north, should not travel north. Man has interrupted water flows all over the entire Everglades and we are going to do it again with an irreversible situation and billions of taxpayer dollars. This is where the 2.6 mile bridge would be located. The locks at 3333 are closed. The water is traveling south down the L67 Canal making a U-turn and going back north you can see here on the map. The Blue Shanty, the new river, allowing large amounts of water flow north. This is the S3334 lock area. It is also closed. When opened and water flows south, this creates that suction, vacuum, dropping the water sometimes overnight or days, 6 to 8 inches. Unnatural, completely, not allowing the wildlife to adapt. This is not what is supposed to happen with the bridging. The bridging has to be thought about. The 1 mile bridge has not flowed a drop of water south ever since finished. The public has completely been misinformed. Taxpayer dollars are not at work. The 100 million dollar bridge has not worked. We have stopped and checked this area 3 to 4 times a week with a simple test. Water is not flowing in any direction and has not. When the lock is opened at the S333, it will flow south but sawgrass will clog the area restricting lots of flow. And again, taxpayer dollars will not be well spent. And right now, we must at least test the 1 mile bridge before creating more bad decisions. Another 2.6 mile bridge and maybe even more bridging. Bridge is not working right now. It has not for many, many months. The only way to make this water flow south is to create an unnatural level in the canal which will flow and flood the area, being detrimental and terrible for wildlife, especially mammal life. Heavy pollution coming from the north will kill aquatic life, affecting the food chain. This is not the Everglades restoration. This is the Everglades destruction.\nComment: This was posted by Eric Kimmel in reply to this video\n\nNot only the pollution and misdirection of water the extended hydro-period caused by stacking the polluted water is have adverse impacts throughout the system.\nFor as long as I can remember despite all the comments and information provided by very knowledgeable people the agencies ignore common sense and science continue abuse our public lands, spend money foolishly on whatsoever pet project the agencies wish to support"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Winter Squirrel Hunting Winter squirrel hunting is a challenging and underutilized sport in Kansas. Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five. I'm Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism.\nComment: wonderful video. very true that squirrel hunters have no competition, especially once the leaves drop, and especially still once cold weather sets in. some day id like to live in a van down by a squirrel infested woodlot. ahhhh."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: beautiful animals, funny how they come right up to the camera, as if they know it's looking at them!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: White, golden and orange tigers are all extremely beautiful, they are most beautiful & most majestic animals ever.

Join Todd Graf and Dean Kreuger both shoot trophy whitetail bucks and have to back out before recovering them the next day.  The rut continues right here on Bowhunt or Die!\nTranscript: Bowhunter Dye is being brought to you by Matthews, Lost Camo, New Archery Products, J.B. Tinks, Lone Wolf Portable Tree Stands, Scent Blocker, Campbell Cameras, and Stealth Cam. Welcome to another action-packed episode of Bowhunter Dye. I'm Justin Zarr and alongside me as always is Todd Graff. You know, Todd, we've got two more really exciting buck hunts to share with our audience this week. We do. You know, it's been a great year. I've been fortunate enough to harvest my second buck here in Illinois. It's a buck's name is Captain Hook. It turned out to be quite the adventure on the recovery but it did work out okay in the end. Yeah, you know, I actually got to play a little part in that recovery but, you know, last week we talked about backing out after an unsure hit which is what you did and actually the other buck that we're going to feature this week which came from Dean Krieger, kind of the same scenario. He was a little bit unsure of the hit so he backed out and, you know, fortunately was able to recover his buck the next day. Right, you know, it's difficult to pull out. It makes really for a sick sleeping evening but in the end it is the smartest thing to do. Well, let's jump right in a tree with Todd on his hunt for Captain Hook. Beautiful buck. I don't know if he went down over there or not, guys. I made a nice Tony Vineyard shot. It looked to me to be a good shot. Oh, he popped right out of this corn. Scared those two smaller bucks away. I'm gonna have to re-watch the footage. I don't know how good of a shot I made or didn't make. I mean, it looked like it wasn't bad but he just didn't act the way I wanted him to act. I may have only got one lung. Let's get out of here. I've learned from experience when you find yourself in situations you just gotta back out, be calm, don't disturb the area. Hopefully he will not go far and he'll expire. Well, the Calvary has arrived. Mike and Justin just showed up. They're not hunting that far away from here so luckily they were able to come give me a hand. You know, that buck came in and I blew it. There's no question about it. I could have been a little bit more calm and I shouldn't have punched the trigger like the way I did. That buck was totally calm. I should have just gave him two more steps and I would have probably had a much better broadside double lung shot but you know what? We did all the stuff right. We pulled out. It's been over four and a half hours now so we're gonna go over at the point of impact, see if we can find my arrow. I'm pretty positive it was a pass through. We've watched the footage over and over and over. He went about 30-40 yards and just stood there for a while so let's see what we can find. I'm hoping that this buck didn't go too far. Let's take a look. We got some blood right here guys. I mean there hasn't been a lot of blood but we're still on the trail so that definitely makes me feel better. We just jumped him. That's not a good sign. That's enough to make you sick right there guys. Wait until tomorrow on this one. I'm here with my friend Scott Hill. He's my neighbor. You know what? It's so great when you got good neighbors when you own hunting property. There's nothing better and more valuable than a good neighbor. Scott was nice enough to, actually he was super nice. He left his wife go hunting this morning and he came out here and helped me track. You know, he went about another 100 yards. We found about four more beds. We just came up around the hill over here and there he is. He's laying right over there. He must have just went up the hill and then came back down. Oh my gosh guys. What an awesome looking deer. Come on take a look at this buck. It's November 7th. You know what? I found my buck, thank goodness, this morning. I shot him yesterday morning. I had great footage. You know, the buck came right in. Unfortunately, I made a mistake. I should have gave that buck at least a couple more seconds and he probably would have turned broadside to me. He's a good four and a half year old. Nice brown horns, heavy mass. He's got this really unique right side. There's nothing better than shooting a freak buck. I can't wait to check my stealth cams out. I'm hoping I got a couple videos up because this is really a good looking buck. He's just a good heavy horn. Nice looking buck. I am extremely happy. I am tagged out in Illinois. I'm going to head now to Wisconsin. I've got two tags left in Wisconsin. I'm going to head up there and see what I can get done in Wisconsin. It's been three years since I put one down up there.\nComment: nice job!!! dont ever give up!!! thats awesome!!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport.

And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: rats are incredibly intelligent and social animals! i used to have them as pets when i was a kid"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: Good shot."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: By the Numbers: Saving the Florida Panther Florida panthers are one of the most endangered animals on the planet. The Nature Conservancy is working with partners to buy critical lands, bringing hope for the future of these majestic animals.\nTranscript: Today, thanks to the efforts of organizations like the Nature Conservancy, the number of Florida panthers that roam the South Florida landscape is growing. About 160 panthers are thought to exist today, up from only 30 in 1995. Will this momentum continue? Can these iconic animals and our communities thrive together? Yes, but we all must play a role in realizing this vision. The tiny piece of our planet Florida panthers call home is simply too small. Cities and other barriers make it almost impossible for panthers to roam and grow. The panther has been tenacious and while their population levels have dropped over time, we've seen them rebound with science and conservation coming together. But they're now at a critical point. They've reached carrying capacity. That's the amount of population they can have in the area they currently live. In 2012, the Nature Conservancy purchased the narrow passage where panthers are crossing the Caloosahatchee River. Protecting this passage gives panthers access to healthy habitat to grow and raise their young. But that habitat could go away if we don't act now. They need more land, and the great thing is that land's available. This area of Florida matters to all of us. These natural and agricultural areas clean our water and air, and the recreation and economic opportunities they present are primary reasons why so many people live in and visit our great state. We have the chance to secure a healthy future for the land, for us, for the panther. What if we miss this opportunity? You can be a part of making sure the number of panthers in the wild can head in the right direction, meaning that this area continues to support not only their growth, but ours too. Today, 160. \nComment: We have moral obligation to preserve Florida's unique Eco system & protect all of its' natural habitants."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

That's the pond pulled to bits, we've removed the large stones from around the side, we've kept them fairly local, just tipped them over the back there to allow us to reshape the top shelf, we've whipped the liner out, there was a little bit of underlay in, carpet underlay, probably covering about 20% of the pond, so it was there as a token gesture, no more, we've dragged the cobbles back a little bit, that'll allow us to build a proper shelf here to retain the cobbles and then just push them back in so they don't need to be moved twice, same with the stones, once we get the shelves done around the sides we'll just be able to lift the stones back into position and cement them in. Right this morning we've reshaped the pond, we've dug the shelves a little bit deeper all the way around the edges, we've created a new shelf around here, the idea being to put a little bit of cement all the way along here, cement in some of these fellas and then pile the rest behind it to prevent them falling in. We've made this inner shelf around here a little bit taller, i.e. a little bit nearer the surface because there wasn't much space for putting marginal plants before, that shelf was pretty deep, it was about 18 inches, which is no good for most plants, we've made another little shelf in the bottom here and we've basically just flattened everything out, ready for the underlay. That's the underlay in now, more or less went in in two long sheets, that's one sheet, that's another sheet, we've sealed it with a heat gun, basically just put a little bit of fire between the two layers and pressed them together in this stick. So now it's time for the liner. That's the liner in now, it's one mil rubber, Firestone liner, we've started filling it up, we're probably going to fill it up until it's just over this shelf here, that should pull the liner in enough for us to work on this top shelf, cementing the stones in. It's pretty important to fill it up sufficiently so it pulls the liner in and makes it tight, otherwise if you just bray on and put the edging stones on when the liner's loose, when you fill it up, it can pull the edging stones in and make a real mess. This is the edging just about half done, we're putting a little ring of cobbles cemented in around the beach edge here, then we can cut the liner off, pour the cobbles back over that and it retains the cobbles quite nicely. We've gone round the sides with stone, well gone halfway round the side with stone, obviously the water's still got quite a long way to come up, but we're going to stop it just shy of those stones there, just in case we get any rain overnight, we don't want it to affect the cement that we've put on. All these gaps will be filled in with soil and then we'll cut the liner off. It's coming together quite well. It's the end of today, we've cemented all the edging stones on, put the cobbles back in position, had a bit of a tidy up around the edges, the water's still got to go up by 8 or 9 inches or so to cover the exposed liner there, but we're leaving it at this level just so it doesn't interfere with the cement. So really now all there is to do is just leave it for a couple of days, top it up and then get the video of the finished pond. That's about it. We've filled the pond up to about 6 inches below its full level, that's to allow the cement that we put around here to go off properly, that was the last bit of cementing that we did, so it'll still come up, probably halfway up these stones that surround the pond here. It's reasonably clear because most of it is water straight out of the tap, although we did put a little bit of pond water back in, it was probably about 300-400 litres went back in. That's it, another one down. If you've liked this video, click the like button, give it a thumbs up, if you haven't liked it, go away and watch some cat playing a blooming keyboard or something.

The lionesses haven't made a successful kill in days. All three are producing milk. They need to replenish their reserves. Kali splits off from the pride, while mother and Ani hide the cubs. She heads to a narrow island that sits just above the water table. In winter, grass above the water line dries out. It's perfect camouflage for a tawny coat. And dry ground is the lechwe's achilles heel, the long hooves that make them fast in the water slow them down on terra firma. The lioness can clock nearly 40 miles per hour on hard ground, but she can only sprint for 100 yards. She has to close the gap between them before she attacks. Kali's impatient. She closes in too fast. The lechwe uses the head start to bolt for the water. Again, the swamp defeats her.\nComment: 2:02 those are some SERIOUS muscles!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

And it's not just his plumes that are unique. So is his way of dancing. This is the King of Saxony, and this is his wife, the Queen of Saxony. That hissing noise is his calling. You can tell he's getting particularly excited because he's erected the black feathers on his shoulders into a cape, another of those transformation tricks that seem to be a speciality of this family. He's so worked up, he's trying to mate with a tuft of moss. A female at last. He's so worked up, he's trying to mate with a tuft of moss. A female at last. Typical female colouring.

The cats' efforts were captured by high-definition and slow-motion cameras for the Saving a Species series for teachers.Subscribe to our channel on YouTube:  to our print magazine:  our Blog:  us on Twitter:  a fan on Facebook:  our TV show: \nTranscript: Today we're shooting an episode of Shamu TV. It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection. It's just something that we've been doing for a long time. We're very passionate about our care for animals and we want to share that with everyone.\nComment: You're right, there are too many insecure people who genuinely want to be victims of make-believe insults.

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age.

The Nature Conservancy is working with partners to buy critical lands, bringing hope for the future of these majestic animals.\nTranscript: Today, thanks to the efforts of organizations like the Nature Conservancy, the number of Florida panthers that roam the South Florida landscape is growing. About 160 panthers are thought to exist today, up from only 30 in 1995. Will this momentum continue? Can these iconic animals and our communities thrive together? Yes, but we all must play a role in realizing this vision. The tiny piece of our planet Florida panthers call home is simply too small. Cities and other barriers make it almost impossible for panthers to roam and grow. The panther has been tenacious and while their population levels have dropped over time, we've seen them rebound with science and conservation coming together. But they're now at a critical point. They've reached carrying capacity. That's the amount of population they can have in the area they currently live. In 2012, the Nature Conservancy purchased the narrow passage where panthers are crossing the Caloosahatchee River. Protecting this passage gives panthers access to healthy habitat to grow and raise their young. But that habitat could go away if we don't act now. They need more land, and the great thing is that land's available. This area of Florida matters to all of us. These natural and agricultural areas clean our water and air, and the recreation and economic opportunities they present are primary reasons why so many people live in and visit our great state. We have the chance to secure a healthy future for the land, for us, for the panther. What if we miss this opportunity? You can be a part of making sure the number of panthers in the wild can head in the right direction, meaning that this area continues to support not only their growth, but ours too. Today, 160. \nComment: 0:59 \"With Science and Conservation working together.\" I would like to know what science has to do with this. \nI need to know for my Project where I have to say how Science is used to protect and preserve the species.

These forests are home to diverse fauna and flora, many of them showing affinities to the Malayan region, but are increasingly threatened by human activity. Several national parks and other protected areas lie within the range, but it is estimated that only a small fraction of the Western Ghats remains in pristine condition. The Silent Valley National Park in Kerala is considered by many to be the last tracts of virgin tropical evergreen forest in India.Biogeographers have long recognized the distinctive plant and animal communities of the Western Ghats. Many of these faunal and floral elements are not found anywhere else in India except in parts of northeastern India.

Really large equipment is going to come and knock these trees down and it's going to be a real upheaval. A property near the headquarters of the Humane Society of the United States will soon be filled with pavement. The road is going to come right through here along this fence line and it's going to go right along these burrow sites. Earth movers are breaking ground, putting many animals, including groundhogs and fox, in harm's way. They wouldn't make it. Fox and groundhogs would likely not make it. The animals would get buried alive, especially since this is ground zero. We know this is where the road is coming through, so we know this area is going to be completely altered. And most of it is going to be gone. So many animals are being relocated. The trapping effort is sort of the last ditch effort to get the remaining animals out of the burrow systems. Take this groundhog brought to a new home miles away. But here she'll be safe. And HSU's staff is stepping in to make sure others survive the habitat loss. I'm fortunate that these animals have been living here for countless years and are going to be losing their homes, so I want to just dedicate a little bit of my time to try to help them and save their lives ultimately.

Now an entirely new home awaits, and hopefully soon enough, this will feel like home. Hopefully we're doing the best we can, giving as many animals a chance as we can.\nComment: This is horrible.

Even a small wild cat can inflict serious injury.In this episode we look at a lesser cat called the Caracal. Their name is taken from a Turkish word that means \"black ear.\" The Caracal is known best for its large black ears that it uses for its great hunting ability.The Caracal roams the grasslands and open plains from Africa through the Middle East. While its numbers are holding in Africa, we see populations becoming extinct in India due to farming and the unrestricted manufacturing of charcoal from the wild weeds, especially in the Banni grasslands. By supporting animal conservation in these areas we can help save the land for the Caracals and other wildlife. Captive Caracals in the US suffer from people trying to keep them as pets, as well as trying to crossbreed them with domestic cats for the pet trade.For more info about BIG CAT RESCUE visit:  us on FACEBOOK:     YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, so today's species spotlight is on the caracal, which most people say, what is a caracal? Well, we're going to show you one and talk a little bit about them. That is Crackle, and she is a caracal. Caracals are sometimes called desert lynx, but in all reality, they are more closely related to your domestic cat at home than to any of the lynx, being either Siberian lynx or Canadian lynx. One of the characteristics that make them very unique is the fact that they have a pretty plain solid coat. There are only a few other cats that have that sort of coat without markings, and that would be cougars and lions, and strangely enough, they are about the same color as the caracals. The caracals have jet black ears, the back of their ears are black, and they have long tufts, just like the lynx, so that's probably why a lot of people associated them with the lynx or thought they were related. So caracals are found throughout Africa, and they're actually found through the Middle East and parts of Asia, and strangely enough, geographically, caracals are found in the same areas that you find cheetahs. Cheetahs and caracals were found in actually the same locations, and one of the things about these two species is they were both trained by humans to hunt animals on behalf of the humans. So the caracals were trained to hunt birds, rabbits, small gazelles, and of course the cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey. Very fascinating that both of these animals were not tamed, but conditioned by humans to hunt animals, and there was actually contests at one time between the caracals to see which one could kill the most birds, the most pigeons in a flock, and the cheetahs, which one could go fastest and bring down the biggest prey. For the most part, the smaller cats, the smaller predators, they eat animals relative to their size, so they would eat smaller birds or mice, but the caracals actually go after much larger prey. So one of the coolest things about the caracals is that they have this uncanny leaping ability, and they can actually catch birds on the wing. They've been recorded in the wild as jumping up to three meters high, which is almost about as high as I am right now. One of the other facts about caracals is they often live in the plains, and a lot of times they're found where the forest meets the plains. This does put them vulnerable to lions, hyenas, leopards, some of the bigger predators, and oftentimes they do fall prey to these larger animals. So they're not always the hunter, a lot of times they become the hunted. So one of the strange things about the caracal is in a lot of their range, especially in Asia and the Middle East, they're considered endangered, because they're very rare. And then on the other hand, in Africa, a lot of times caracals are considered nuisance, and they're just simply killed because they're a threat to livestock. Here at Big Cat Rescue, all of our caracals were former pets. Along with the serval, the caracal is just very popular among cat collectors, and probably one of the biggest misconceptions with the caracals is the fact that they are so cute when they are babies. They are the most adorable little kittens you've ever seen. Most people don't realize they're going to grow up to be this hissy animal that's going to spray on everything and try to bite you all the time. And there's been several attempts to hybridize these animals, some successful, some not successful, with domestic cats to give everyone sort of an exotic cat that's not quite wild. To me, that's a pretty shady thing to do. These are truly wild animals, great hunters out in the wild. They shouldn't be put in cages. They absolutely shouldn't be diluted down with domestic cat DNA. That's not what they were made to be. And here at Big Cat Rescue, of course, our philosophy is these animals belong in the wild, and the only way that we can ever accomplish that is if we preserve enough habitat in the \nComment: Eaxctly, that is a problem. YOU CAN help Make A Difference by going to CatLaws. com and letting lawmakers know how you feel.

She told her to go and to be free and to eat. And that's exactly what she's done, and she's been just a wonderful animal. She's really enjoyed Crackle. Here of late, though, she's been sick. We found her in her den, just being cold and unresponsive, so we brought her into the camp hospital. And our big cat rescuers have been hand-feeding her and giving her lots of attention. She's perked up beautifully, and it's raining outside. So until we have better weather, we'll keep her inside here. We're going to keep her warm and dry.

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: And this is the work of the master builder among bower birds. I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: i want a bower bird to arrange my dream wedding"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets.

They suspect that poachers killed their mother for her pelt. At first, everyone thinks they're leopard cubs. It turns out they're the rarest of finds. Two clouded leopard cubs. The find captures the imagination of top Indian wildlife photographer Sandesh Kadur. Cats have always fascinated me, and when I heard about these clouded leopards being rehabilitated back into the wild, I dropped everything and rushed to the spot to document the whole process. In terms of filming a new species of cat, I mean, this was it. This is the holy grail. Clouded leopards are amazing creatures, the smallest of the big cats. Shy and elusive, even cat specialists know little about their habits in the wild. Just keeping them alive is a big challenge. A leading vet, Dr. Bhaskar Chowdhury, takes charge of caring for these very special cubs. That was the first experience for me to see wild clouded leopard cubs for the first time in my life. So I was really excited and also a bit nervous because the onus is on us, the veterinarians, to make them survive. Bhaskar is determined that the cubs don't end up in the zoo like most orphaned big cats. He gets permission to try something totally unprecedented, to teach clouded leopard cubs how to be wild. It's totally new, never been tried, never been tested, and people, you know, many scientists won't believe this. It's a huge gamble. If his new protocol succeeds, it will boost dwindling numbers of clouded leopards in their real home, the forest. If they get it wrong, the cubs will die.\nComment: OMG!!

She was hit by a car a few weeks back, and if you wonder why I'm kind of talking low, well right behind me, a few acres back, that's our rehab area, and that's where Bellina and any other rehab bobcats we might get live before they're released, and she's going to go there. It's a very naturalistic enclosure. There's lots of places for her to hide. We have her, her enclosure's a little bit set up for handicapped animals, did just have all that surgery on her leg, so it enables her to get around. So even though Bellina looks a little bit freaked out right now, she's running up and down the side of the closure. That's actually a good sign for us. It means she doesn't want to be caged up. She wants to get out of captivity, and the good thing about our rehab area, it's a very quiet area. It's nice and isolated, so she's going to be able to peacefully recover from her surgery back there. She'll sort of relearn how to hunt with her repaired leg, and really, even though she's stressed out right now, or she seems stressed out, she's going to have a good, quiet recovery, and there's no way she's going to get accustomed to people. So in the rehab bobcat cage, we have a way to feed them remotely, so we can put the prey animals, which are usually live rats, we can put them in these tubes, and the tubes have several different splits, and they can end up popping up in any area of the cage, and we have this enclosure completely covered with old trees, logs, brush, a lot of places for the prey animal to hide, as well as for the bobcat to hide, so they really have to fine-tune their senses, watch out for these prey animals, and really, it gets them ready for release back into the wild. She's still being fed dead prey right now, but in a couple weeks, we'll be able to feed live prey through the tubes, so she'll be able to relearn how to hunt, relearn how to use that repaired leg. You might wonder how we are aware of the progress of our rehab bobcats, and actually, what we do is we have several remote cameras back there, so we can watch the rehab enclosure from all angles, and we never have people around the enclosure. This really gives us a great idea of how well the animal is hunting, if it's hunting, and really, how ready it is for release. It's pretty amazing, and we're keeping our fingers crossed that real soon, come spring, when there's lots of prey animals out there, she'll be healthy and healed, and we can release her back like we have the previous ones. You can help us change the way people treat big cats by texting TIGER to 20222.\nComment: Congrats to Bellona!\n\nYou guys interested in a house cat that thinks she's a big cat?

She's young, those missies. Uh-oh. She didn't go back the other way. Maybe she's going to eat that tree. I don't think so. They don't eat that tree much. She's just tasting it. This is about as close as you can get to a moose. Are you scared? Are you scared of the big moose? Are you? I think that moose is... I don't know. That moose is not real happy. I think it might be stressed or something. Well, apparently it doesn't like us. Why wouldn't it like us? We're nice people. No. I don't think it's going to hurt that tree.

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: @MediumRoastEspresso That would of been a perfect song for this LOL!

The hyenas moo to show affection like a cat purrs.  Then they laugh when getting ready to eat.   They are one of the most intelligent and powerful animas in the world.  Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not.

I've only heard a couple gobbles, but we had a really windy night, so I don't know how vocal the birds are going to be. The game camera is showing birds are coming in here a little later in the morning, 1030-11 o'clock, so this may be a little longer hunting than we're used to, but we're going to give it a shot, and if we can keep the mosquitoes off of us, that'll be a pretty good morning. We're going to go ahead and get blacked out and see what happens. I've got 100 pictures of him too. I've got 3400 pictures of him in one day, so it's pretty good. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Well, we got a little surprised on him. We knew we'd heard a bird over there probably, I don't know, 20 or 30 minutes ago, but he went quiet on us, and just out of the corner of my eye, I caught a bird strutting near the edge of the timber, and we didn't even call at him. He was bouncing in the timber already, strutting out in front of us. I couldn't shoot him for a long time because he was so close to it, but I'm pretty sure we got a decent shot off. It didn't screw up the decoy too bad, but it put him down, so let's go out here and see what he looks like. Well, opening morning's paid off pretty good for us. I'd done some pretty good scouting here, and the pictures were showing the birds were here, but man, when we set up this morning, we wasn't very confident in it. We had some birds quite a ways behind us, and then over here across the creek, we knew there were some birds. Well, we even talked about getting up and moving, but we went ahead and stuck it out for another 20, 30 minutes, and one of the birds we'd heard over across the creek, evidently he had moved in on us, and we didn't see him until he was about 30 yards away. He strutted out here, put on a good show for us, and we put the tag on one opening morning.\nComment: I look forward to your videos :3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The bucks are the ones with the brown on their heads - the brown is staining from tree bark as they rub their antlers on trees.  They will be snow white again when they shed their winter coats.  They are not regulars in our neck of the woods so we didn't have the opportunity to see them with their antlers.  We sure would have loved to.  We did get a brief glimpse of the old buck with his wide, palmated antlers.  It seems that as the albino bucks age their antlers get thicker & thicker.  We learned shortly after this filming that the old buck (with the limp) was taken by wolves.  They only came around a few days but we sure enjoyed seeing them.  The big buck especially, who we called Big Al, was absolutely magnificent.  So far we haven't had a glimpse of the two remaining bucks this winter.\nTranscript: ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪\nComment: it looks like you have a whole herd of whites. my friend you are truely blessed to have seen such a thing.

Hi, Rebecca! There's a camper and the Jeep and that's the lake. That's Muska Lounge Lake. Notice how there's not people on top of people on top of people. I guess, I never showed you guys that at the other campground. Anyway, this is a nice campground. And look, grass, not dirt. The campground that we stayed at last weekend, it was all dirt. Every single campsite was dirt. Which is just crazy. So, we're getting ready to head on the road. Head on the road. We're gonna head on the road? Head on the road. Whatever. So, we just left the campground and we are headed to Oswald's Bear Ranch. They have the north, I think the largest collection of black bears, is it? Probably. Largest collection of black bears in the United States. Or at least like on this side of the United States. Cause we were at a black bear ranch one time out west and they had a lot of bears too. I think they had a large collection of bears though, not just black bears. Yeah, I think they had like grizzly bears. Yeah, they had a Kodiak. I remember that. And this guy just has just black bears. So, we're gonna go see some bears. Not you girls. You girls are gonna have to sit in the car with the air conditioner on for a little bit. That's why we have two sets of keys. We're at the bear ranch. There's their dens. And way back there we see a bear. These are the female bears, I believe. There's a big bear right there. Just a walking. They just remind me of dogs. Imagine what it sounds like when they get all playing. Yeah. Probably like Shelby and Oakley. Yeah. Look a bear, panting just like the dogs. We don't have any apples. We didn't buy any apples yet. And don't look like he needs many apples. Pretty cool. What's up dude? What's up? Are you hot? I think these are the females he said. Yeah, and she looks like she could be pregnant. No, they're getting ready for hibernation, Jamie. Oh, that's right. Man, looks like an apple. There's that one sleeping under a tree. There's another one walking down here. I think they said there's seven in this enclosure. They have 29 all together here. Look, another bear. This one just sat down to stare at Rebecca. What do you think, Rebecca? You ever been that close to a bear? No. What are you doing, huh? Just chilling out in there? Just chilling out. She's a little smaller than the last one. Yeah, she is. Oh, look at this one. It reminds me of Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh. Kind of hanging out. Is that comfortable? Sure looks comfortable. Are you a boy? No, that's a girl. Them other ones must have been boys. Look how little she is. She's just a-walking. Looking for food. Here she goes. Looking away. Looking away. She makes a loop. And eyes. Boom. She's looking for an apple. Yeah, she wants to make sure it's not up here. Let's keep walking. We'll go find more. There's lots more. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one here's sitting up. He's like, Oh, but I wanted an apple. Those people are feeding the bears apples. So they're going to follow them all the way around. They're going to try to anyway. Uh-huh. This one's playing in the water. Didn't think he was going to. Look. King of the mountain. Yep, always balancing. He's going to lay right down in the water. Oh, I bet that feels good. That's funny. Both of them are like, Slowly going. How cool is that? So, where are we? The bear pen. Oswald, the bear pen. Bear pen. Oswald's bear ranch. In Newberry. In Newberry. Yep. Got Rebecca. And a big fence. There's bears in there. There's bears in there. I got some on my list down there too. There's big male bears in there somewhere. Yeah, there's a couple ten year old black bears in here. I don't know. Where are we going next? Fayette. Fayette? Way down to Fayette? I don't know. Are we going to stop there first? Probably stop somewhere first. I have no idea. Uh, seen? Wildlife refuge? Maybe. Maybe we'll do that on the way back for that time. Maybe. Anyway. I was just wondering why I brought this camera. So now you can clip this out. Bye. More bears. I think that was the one we just saw swimming. Oh look, he's going to climb the tree. There he goes. You can do it dude. Get it, get it, get it. It's not as little as it used to be. These are juvenile bears. They're playing back there. Want it? There's your little big truck bear. Come on. Yeah, I think he's a little big for up there. There's one big bear. Check him out. He's pretty big. Well, there's a big boy. What's up big boy? There's another big boy back there. Yeah. The claws will kill you. Oh, big yawn. Oh, baby yawn. What's up, huh? Oh, you gotta get up, huh? Gotta move. No, you can stay. No, that one's yawning. I'm tired too. We're leaving. I hit the camera. We're leaving Oswald's Bear Ranch and now we're heading down to Newberry. That was pretty cool. If you're ever up here and you're thinking about whether or not you should stop, you should stop. Cause I had fun. Did you have fun? I had fun. Did you have fun, Rebecca? Yes, I had fun. And the dogs did well sitting in the car. We didn't leave them for too long. So, on to Newberry, I guess. It was neat to see all the bears playing. Yeah, we got some cool video we'll show you guys. And I guess if you're gonna go, you gotta go early in the morning while they're out moving around. Yeah, cause once it gets hot, they're not... They don't like to be out. Why are you in my face? Put in my face. Jamie's outside putting air in the camper tires and the Jeep tires. We got one dog. We got two dogs. We got all three dogs. There's camper. Can't see it cause the window's really dirty. There's Jamie. He just put air in the tires.

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Our Primate Cousins Photo slideshow of various primates I've worked with at a wild animal park (except the orangutans and gorillas, which were photographed elsewhere). Humans belong to the taxonomic Order Primates, which is comprised of 11 Families, 52 Genera, & 181 species. Primates are divided into two main groups: Prosimians (literally \"before monkeys/apes) and Anthropoids (literally \"man like\"). The evolution of primates is characterized by trends toward mobile limbs, grasping hands, a flattened face, binocular vision, a large, complex brain, & a reduced reproductive rate. Most Primates are well adapted to arboreal living (living in trees).Primate evolution occurred primarily during the Cenozoic Era, Prosimians first branching off in the early Eocene Epoch 58 mya (million years ago).Around 33 mya, during the Oligocene Epoch, the Anthropoids split off into 3 main groups: New World Monkeys (w/prehensile tails), Old World Monkeys (w/out prehensile tails), & the Hominoids (eventual Apes & Humans w/out any tails).In the Miocene Epoch, around 15 mya, Asian Apes & African Apes diverged paths. At approx. 6 mya, African Apes & Human lineage split, producing Hominids (members of the taxonomic Human Family Hominidae) in a region of Central Africa called the Great Rift Valley. There, dense jungle gave way to great savannah plains, & bipedalism became a helpful adaptation in surviving in a high grass environment w/a variety of predators. To this day, Chimpanzees & Humans share 98.5% of the same DNA sequences, even though millions of years separate us from a common ancestor. The evidence for evolution has been found within the fossil record. Additional corroboration has been found comparing DNA sequences which show dramatic linkages between all modern primate species. A comparative study of mitochondrial DNA shows that the differences among present human populations are consistent w/their having a common ancestor no more than a million years ago.Prosimian (lemurs, tarsiers, bushbabies & lorises)0:26-0:45 Ring Tailed LemurAnthropoids (monkeys, apes & humans)  New World Monkeys (w/prehensile tails)0:52-1:02 Black Tamarin Marmoset1:03-1:10 Squirrel Monkey1:11-1:18 Capuchin Monkey1:19-1:26 Woolly Monkey1:27-2:10 Spider Monkey **1:47-1:51 a spider monkey is investigating/ harassing a river turtle.**1:52-1:57 two spider monkeys are investigating/ harassing an alligator.Old World Monkeys (w/out prehensile tails)2:13-2:36 Vervet Monkey aka Green Monkey or Guenon or Grivet **These are the monkeys scientists have thus far linked as a carrier species for the RNA retrovirus associated w/HIV/AIDS.2:37-3:43 Rhesus Macaque**3:13-3:43 show a troop of rhesus macaques interacting w/Sika & Fallow deer, as well as Mouflon sheep & raccoons.Hominoids (apes & humans, w/out any tail) Asian Apes3:45-3:53 White Handed Gibbon3:54-4:08 OrangutanAfrican Apes4:11-4:32 Lowland Gorilla4:33-4:59 ChimpanzeeHuman4:52-4:59 Me kissing a Chimpanzee ^_^All photographs are the property of Dafttool & cannot be reproduced or used without the expressed authorization of Dafttool.\nTranscript: You You You You We Hey Everyone can see we're together All of the people around us they say Can they be that close?

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Tiger Shed Bobcat Box Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: So what's the story on this cat? Okay, this cat is at a place called a rescue farm, which apparently is a chain of rescues in Florida. I think there's three other ones, and they specialize in horses and small animals. And they have this tiger, the lady who, I don't know if she founded it or she was at least the permit holder there, is now hospitalized and doesn't have a good outlook. And one of the things that you can never plan for when you own a tiger is, you know, the inevitability of you're getting old. And the lady who owns Tigger is actually a patient in that hospital, right across the street. She's unable to take care of the cat. Hopefully that wasn't her. She's unable to take care of the cat, and it's left in the hands of people who don't know what they're doing, and more importantly, they don't have a license. Scary. They actually had a cougar, and they have a tiger, and a bobcat there. And the cougar has died, and the tiger is inside of a shed, and in a chain-link enclosure, and it has both sides of this, basically just a dog kennel. And they used to take her, when she was younger, they would take her to retirement homes to visit the elderly, and she walked on a leash everywhere. And of course, like everyone, everything else, when they get too big, that stops. The rescue farm has been sold to new owners, which are going to continue, but just in the capacity of smaller horses and smaller animals, like pocket pet type animals. The tiger's got to go. There'll be no permit holder on the property, and the bobcat's got to go. But as far as the tiger goes, none of who we label the bad guys want this tiger, because she has been spayed. And when I saw her last time, she is absolutely one of the most beautiful, big, just from appearance, Siberian tigers that I've ever seen. And she's been declawed and spayed, so she's of not much value for the breeder, so they don't want her. And basically, it puts Fish and Wildlife in a position where this tiger has nowhere to go, and they have no one that will take it, so the only thing they can do is euthanize it. And it's, you know, it's a lot of money. She's only six years old, so we're looking at probably 14-15 years of huge food bills, vet bills, and as always, you know, it's people that meant well in the beginning, but situations change, as they always do, and there's nowhere for it to go. It's been in this shed for at least three years since it's been outside and seen the sunlight, and when I saw it the first time, it was straining to climb the chain link to look outside and actually get a glimpse of the outside world. So it would be awesome to give this girl a good life. So this cat has never had, like, I mean, in the past three years, like, fresh air, or seen the outside, or anything? No, not at all. And before that, she only went outside on a leash, so it's not like she ever had an outdoor enclosure, or that she ever got to swim and run on grass and have any sort of life. So it's essentially, this has been it for her, but she's huge. She's about 600 pounds. She's a big tiger. And didn't you tell me that the other side of the kennel that she now has, the double side too, that the other side was where the cougar was living for initially, so she's only had half of that space? Absolutely, she's only had half of that space, and you know, there's just, just looking at it, you kind of cringe because there's tire swings hanging in there, stuff that she could get hurt on, and I don't know how. I mean, it's Florida. They hose that thing out. I don't know if she's ever dry, if that concrete is ever dry. And with her being declawed in the front, we know, we know what declawed cats end up looking like when they're on concrete. And this lady that's in the hospital, she's, you know, all she can think of, she's really not with it anymore, and she knows, she's just so emotionally attached to this tiger, and it's the same thing as we just saw in this chimp attack. She recently lost her husband and her own mother, and she's just projecting all of her hopes on this cat, and she's so devastated at the thought of giving it up that it's very, very hard for her. You know, it's just, it's such a reality check. She's never, ever gonna be able to take care of animals again, and you know, she's never gonna be able to afford animals again, and yet she's still worried. Her big concern is, is giving up her license to own these animals. She has concerns that that would somehow prevent her from ever working with animals again, and it's that, and that's, that's honestly her reality. She, you know, it sounds like if she's in liver failure, she may not even ever live outside of a hospital again, and yet, still in the back of her mind, that's bothering her, that she might have to give up that permit to own these kind of animals. And you see that all the time, where it's more about what the people feel like they're losing. It's not about what's best for the animal, it's about them, and it shouldn't be about them. Now, the cool part is the two ladies, the mother and daughter, that work there, that are taking care of this cat, they know that it's wrong, and they, they feel terrible. And again, I, you know, it's, I just think in their mind, they're doing everything they can, and they know it's not right. And when I talked to them, they, they almost seemed embarrassed, like they're ashamed of being part of this cat, but yet when they talk about her, they want to just, you know, they want to go in with her, they want to hug her, they just think of her. There's even a sign that says she's just a big house cat, and they just don't get it. They don't get it. And I mean, thankfully, this is honestly one of the most mild-mannered tigers I have ever seen, which is a good thing, because they'd probably both be dead by now. Do they go in with her? They, they say, they say that they don't, and they say that they don't take her out on the leash anymore, because they don't have, they're not legally licensed to own her. But, good Lord. That's the only reason? When I was there, they surely just opened that door, right, and tried to call her over there. Okay, I'm staying in the car for that one. And then when they saw how I reacted, oh, she won't come out, I said, yeah. Favorite last words. Yeah, exactly. And how does the owner justify this cat being in this shed? That's, that's not how she sees it. She sees that as, as part of what makes her complete, and that that's just a temporary situation. They always, you know, they always have grandiose plans that we're gonna have this huge outdoor enclosure with waterfalls, and caves, and huge swimming pools, and that's exactly what they told me. Well, the plan was to enclose a whole acre for her, and have a waterfall every time. You could probably, that, isn't that a broken record? Every time. Every one of these sanctuary sites that you go to has these incredible multi-million dollar plans of how they're gonna be taking care of these animals someday. If somebody would just send them the money, and when people do send them the money, it ends up going to salaries, it doesn't, they get more animals. But this is three years in the making still. Well, you know what, Barbara, when I asked them, because they said, well, she used to go outside all the time, and she used to do this, I said, well, honestly, when was the last time she's been outside? And they both kind of looked at each other, and they tried to figure it out in their heads, and then they were both, I mean, really hurt that it was three years. I don't think it even crossed their mind how long she had been in that shed. It's horrifying, and they, and I mean, the area is lined with cages with raccoons, and foxes, and chinchillas, and ferrets, and all these other animals in tiny, tiny cages, and then they have a piece of tape on the floor, because school kids come out there and take care of the little animals, and it's just, there's a piece of red tape that they know if you step over that line, you're too close to the tiger. Kids, school kids, elementary kids, and yet that's all that the state requires.\nComment: does anyone know the update on this beautiful tiger...i am heart broken ever since i have seen this video and the idea of putting her to sleep is killing me :( BIG CAT RESCUE is there anyway we can help to get this tiger saved!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: What would we be without animals ?

And home to the Saltwater Crocodile. Abundant cattle and birdlife can be seen along its shores. And this provides an excellent food source for the Saltwater Crocodile. Crocodiles in this area are some of the largest seen anywhere in the world. With an estimated 20 crocodiles per kilometre of river, this truly is the land of the giants. Fights break out often in the crocodile world, usually for the best spot. Here it is in slow motion. Watch for the snap. Bam! Of course I went there to see the giant crocodiles. Here is a normal sized croc. And here is Maximus. Estimated to be between 6 and 7 metres in length. As you can imagine, he is very good at intimidating his rivals. He is rarely seen on the bank, probably because of his massive size. This area of the Ord River is adjacent to many cattle properties. Seen here is a helicopter doing a survey, possibly checking how many of their cattle are still alive. Often crocodiles are seen grouped together. Here you can see four crocodiles hanging around in the one spot. Recently a local cattle station reported that they lose one to two cows per day to crocodile attacks. And with the sheer numbers of crocodiles I have seen in this area, I have no doubt. This has been Jeremy Rook, crocstalker.com. Thanks for watching. Please subscribe to my channel.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Top 3 Most Memorable Wild Animal Experiences Spawned from a viewer comment, I discuss 2 (actually 3) of my most memorable animal experiences while in the backcountry. And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: The bull moose was interesting and a good reason why you should not pack a banana along with your gun. But that would have made a great video."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: Thank You...   I also subbed to you as well."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Nature and Trees - A Squirrel - A Wonderful Creation Of Nature (Pls Watch in Full HD 720 or 1080 )I found this amazing Grizzled Giant Squirrel on a tree in front of my resort hotel room during my holidays. There were a few notices put up by the hotel indicating that wild animals are not to be fed. Since this squirrel looked rather tame and more familiar with the surroundings I thought of giving it a banana :) May be it was used to the hotel guests feeding it. I was very close and was able to admire it while it was feeding itself. The surrounding of the resort hotel chalet where we stayed was rather interior and was bordering a Wildlife Sanctuary. Grizzled Giant Squirrel - (Ratufa Macroura) ================================= The grizzled giant squirrel is a large tree squirrel found in the highlands of Sri Lanka and India. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as near threatened due to habitat loss and hunting. Countries - Native - India , Sri Lanka Taxonomic Notes - There are three very distinct subspecies, with one present in India and all three present in Sri Lanka. Red List Category & Criteria - Near Threatened Justification - Listed as Near Threatened because this species is probably in significant decline due to habitat loss and hunting throughout much of its range. Range Description - This species is endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. In India it is known from only five severely fragmented locations, while it occurs more widely and less fragmented in Sri Lanka. Population - The Indian population has been estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals, and the population has been decling due to habitat loss and hunting The population of this species is considerably higher in Sri Lanka. Habitat and Ecology - It is a diurnal and arboreal species. It occurs in tropical dry deciduous and montane forests, where it is confined to the riverine habitats. It has a generation time of ~7-8 years. Major Threats- Habitat loss and degradation due to agro-industry farming, small-scale logging, selective logging, increase in human settlements, forest fire, inter-specific competition, competition from alien species, hunting for local consumption purposes, presence of domestic predators have been observed to be the major threats for this species. The grizzled giant squirrel's common name came from the grey to brown colouration highlighted with white at the top of the tail, giving it a grizzled appearance. The rest of the body varies in colour geographically and may be brown, red, grey or black, but the fur on the underside is always lighter than the back. This agile climber is adapted for life spent almost entirely in the trees, and has a very long tail for balance, broad hands for climbing and large claws for gripping branches. The ears are short, round and sometimes tufted.Music By Lohstana David from Jamendo .com\nTranscript: \nComment:  ~ EXCELLENT ~ i love squirrels & critters\n\nI have a few animal & squirrel videos on my channel"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

She was found chained to a wall in a drug house during a law enforcement raid in Tennessee. Because she'd been confined to live on a concrete floor, she had huge swollen masses on her elbows that took months to heal, and was severely underweight. As you can see, she's made a full recovery since being rescued and is now the largest lion we have at the sanctuary, even bigger than our male lions Joseph and Cameron. Because she's such a big girl who just loves to frolic, run around and play, we wanted to provide Nikita with a large addition to her enclosure that she'd be able to explore and enjoy. Big Cat Rescue is situated on 55 acres in Tampa, Florida, and we're home to over 100 rescued exotic cats that were previously unwanted, abandoned or abused. The sanctuary seeks to provide the very best home we can for the cats in our care, and educate the public about the plight of these magnificent animals. The cats' enclosures are created to provide as natural an environment as possible, including trees for our leopards, who love to climb, pools for the tigers, so they can cool off, and even fresh sand for our sand cats to enjoy. So with Nikita in mind, and our goal set in place, we put our Big Cat plan into action. We wanted Nikita's new habitat to include an additional 3,500 square feet. So we needed to build an enclosure addition that measured 50 feet by 70 feet in size, at a cost of approximately $20,000. We put the word out to our supporters, and they definitely roared into action. Big Cat Rescue is fortunate to have supporters around the world who not only enable us to provide for the well-being of the cats, but also that of the sanctuary's fiscal sustainability. Lawrence and Pamela Tristle are two long-time supporters who generously donated half the cost to build Nikita's enclosure expansion as a matching grant, and hundreds of other supporters responded to help meet our goal. The first thing we had to do was make room for the addition, which meant lots of trimming, weeding, root removal, and leveling of the ground. Thanks to volunteers from the U.S. Army Citrus Park Recruiting Station here in Tampa, and of course, Big Cat Rescue volunteers, this was accomplished in record time, while Nikita kept busy watching over all involved. The perimeter of Nikita's new addition was marked out, and construction began. The walls of the enclosure were to be 15 feet in height, with a 5-foot cantilever, making the total height of the enclosure approximately 18 feet. Once all of the posts were in place, over 50 panels were hung, reinforced, cut to size, and then fixed in place. This process took almost three weeks to complete, and I'm sure Nikita was feeling a little sympathetic towards the workers. Then, the big day arrived. The Big Cat transformation was complete. Donors, volunteers, interns, and staff members alike all turned out to see Nikita take her first steps in her new territory. Everything was in place, including Nikita's favorite big yellow boomer ball, as well as a paper mache warthog for her to make friends with. Nikita was definitely ready to explore, while everybody eagerly looked on, and she didn't disappoint. Take a look. Big Cat Rescue would like to thank everyone who made this possible. Nikita may show her appreciation in unique ways, but thanks to our supporters, donors, and volunteers, we've truly enriched the life of this big girl.\nComment: I just made a tiny little donation to the BCR :) I know it's nothing, compared to how much these cats need, but that's all I can currently afford. Makes me feel one of the pride, in a way :))) My heart is with your cats and all animals, ever. All the best! :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

That's the pond pulled to bits, we've removed the large stones from around the side, we've kept them fairly local, just tipped them over the back there to allow us to reshape the top shelf, we've whipped the liner out, there was a little bit of underlay in, carpet underlay, probably covering about 20% of the pond, so it was there as a token gesture, no more, we've dragged the cobbles back a little bit, that'll allow us to build a proper shelf here to retain the cobbles and then just push them back in so they don't need to be moved twice, same with the stones, once we get the shelves done around the sides we'll just be able to lift the stones back into position and cement them in. Right this morning we've reshaped the pond, we've dug the shelves a little bit deeper all the way around the edges, we've created a new shelf around here, the idea being to put a little bit of cement all the way along here, cement in some of these fellas and then pile the rest behind it to prevent them falling in. We've made this inner shelf around here a little bit taller, i.e. a little bit nearer the surface because there wasn't much space for putting marginal plants before, that shelf was pretty deep, it was about 18 inches, which is no good for most plants, we've made another little shelf in the bottom here and we've basically just flattened everything out, ready for the underlay. That's the underlay in now, more or less went in in two long sheets, that's one sheet, that's another sheet, we've sealed it with a heat gun, basically just put a little bit of fire between the two layers and pressed them together in this stick. So now it's time for the liner. That's the liner in now, it's one mil rubber, Firestone liner, we've started filling it up, we're probably going to fill it up until it's just over this shelf here, that should pull the liner in enough for us to work on this top shelf, cementing the stones in. It's pretty important to fill it up sufficiently so it pulls the liner in and makes it tight, otherwise if you just bray on and put the edging stones on when the liner's loose, when you fill it up, it can pull the edging stones in and make a real mess. This is the edging just about half done, we're putting a little ring of cobbles cemented in around the beach edge here, then we can cut the liner off, pour the cobbles back over that and it retains the cobbles quite nicely. We've gone round the sides with stone, well gone halfway round the side with stone, obviously the water's still got quite a long way to come up, but we're going to stop it just shy of those stones there, just in case we get any rain overnight, we don't want it to affect the cement that we've put on. All these gaps will be filled in with soil and then we'll cut the liner off. It's coming together quite well. It's the end of today, we've cemented all the edging stones on, put the cobbles back in position, had a bit of a tidy up around the edges, the water's still got to go up by 8 or 9 inches or so to cover the exposed liner there, but we're leaving it at this level just so it doesn't interfere with the cement. So really now all there is to do is just leave it for a couple of days, top it up and then get the video of the finished pond. That's about it. We've filled the pond up to about 6 inches below its full level, that's to allow the cement that we put around here to go off properly, that was the last bit of cementing that we did, so it'll still come up, probably halfway up these stones that surround the pond here. It's reasonably clear because most of it is water straight out of the tap, although we did put a little bit of pond water back in, it was probably about 300-400 litres went back in. That's it, another one down. If you've liked this video, click the like button, give it a thumbs up, if you haven't liked it, go away and watch some cat playing a blooming keyboard or something.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: A Growing Population of Mexican Wolves Endangered Mexican wolves are making a comeback in Arizona and New Mexico. Watch as wildlife managers count Mexican wolves to find out if 2014 is a record-breaking year. This video was created by the Information Branch of the Arizona Game and Fish Dept. Producer: David Majure.\nTranscript: December 2014 in the White Mountains of Arizona, a trail cam placed near the carcass of an elk records a pack of Mexican wolves showing up for breakfast. It's nothing unusual, yet it's absolutely extraordinary, especially when you consider that Mexican wolves nearly became extinct. By the early 1970s, there were zero wild Mexican wolves in the United States, and only a smattering could still be found in Mexico. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Mexican wolf as an endangered species in 1976. Today, Mexican wolves are making a comeback in Arizona and New Mexico, thanks to a captive breeding program and a reintroduction project that's been releasing and managing wolves since 1998. It's a partnership between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the Forest Service, the White Mountain Apache Tribe, and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. From the get-go, the goal was a self-sustaining population of at least 100 wolves by 2006. It's taken us almost 10 years after that to even come close to that number. Go find a location on RIM, go find Tsewa, only you're going to be over there on White Mountain. Jeff Dolphin is team leader for Arizona Game and Fish on the interagency field team, which does the day-to-day management of this experimental population of Mexican wolves. Does anybody not know what they're doing tomorrow? At the end of each year, the team does a population survey to find out how many wolves are living in the wild. We've got 10 animals, we're just trying to find 1331. The front seat can just turn the antenna and find the wolf just by turning it that way. They use radio telemetry to search for wolves wearing radio collars. When they find a wolf without a collar, or one that needs a new one, they may try to capture it. Chasing wolves through tall trees in a helicopter is difficult. It's probably some of the most demanding flying I do, just between the terrain, the trees, and trying to follow a running wolf through the trees without running into anything. It's very demanding. And sticking it with a tranquilizer dart is never easy. I'm looking out of the helicopter or muggers on the side trying to locate the wolves with the radio telemetry. What you're witnessing is wildlife management in action. It's unbelievably challenging. You just got to be patient and persistent. And it's infinitely rewarding. All of these wolves right now are wild born, wild raised, and they're surviving on their own. They're not needing help to survive from us. They're doing what we want them to do, but we're really seeing a dramatic incline in the population right now. When a wolf is delivered, the processing team goes to work immediately. Who's doing the microchips? This animal came in pretty hot from the chase and everything else, and through the IV fluids and cold packs, we've actually got her temperature back down to normal. The team documents the wolf's physical characteristics. It provides immunizations, monitors vital signs, and does any doctoring that's needed. So this is pretty much a resolving bite wound. The priority is to get the animal collared and back into the wild as soon and as safely as possible. For three straight years, the Mexican wolf population has increased by at least 10%. But this year's count was better than ever. The 2014 Mexican wolf population survey documented a minimum of 109 wolves in the wild, a 31% increase that finally broke the century mark. We're busting at the seams with wolves right now for this recovery area. With 19 packs and 38 pups, the future is bright for Mexican wolves. And it's only getting brighter. In 2015, big changes to the rules governing the recovery efforts gave Mexican wolves more room to roam. The area they're allowed to occupy in Arizona and New Mexico grew from 7,000 to more than 150,000 square miles. And the goal for the number of wolves more than tripled, from 100 to as many as 325. It's a number the project partners believe will give the wolves the greatest chance of success. A number that strikes a balance between the wolf population, available prey resources, and public acceptance. A number that ensures the Mexican wolf's comeback continues.\nComment: One must learn, to ignor the foolish ways of man, and walk in a sacred manner. I am glad, you are trying.

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: Breeding related question: I know Zabu is fixed (and not really one to breed off anyway), do you ever keep Cats un-fixed in case they're needed for breeding programs in other rescues and zoos?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not. But kind of like a\nComment: *seeing her go on with the talking* Hey!

I think I went in a little back, but he was quartered towards the front shoulder. I think it was a solid, solid shot. I don't think he went far. It didn't sound like it the way he was crashing. He was down. He didn't go... He didn't go far. I'll tell you what, he wasn't out long enough. You know what? I'm shaking with you, dude. I'm shaking with you, dude. That TruGlow pin, man, I'll tell you what, it's not very lighted out, and that thing just lit up right on his vitals. And I guarantee you something, he ain't real happy about that wasp going through his pump house. That wasp just wailed him. Oh. Oh. Ha! This is it, baby. We're going to take a couple minutes here, relax, let him lay, and go see what we got, see if we can put our hands on him. Whew! Well, we waited a little while. We heard him crash. We know he went down really quick. There's blood right at the scene of the crime. So we're just going to follow it out real easy here, and I don't think he went far. I mean, that wasp went right through his boiler room, man, and he is bleeding really good, so I feel really confident about this hit.

Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Nature and Trees - A Squirrel - A Wonderful Creation Of Nature (Pls Watch in Full HD 720 or 1080 )I found this amazing Grizzled Giant Squirrel on a tree in front of my resort hotel room during my holidays. There were a few notices put up by the hotel indicating that wild animals are not to be fed. Since this squirrel looked rather tame and more familiar with the surroundings I thought of giving it a banana :) May be it was used to the hotel guests feeding it. I was very close and was able to admire it while it was feeding itself. The surrounding of the resort hotel chalet where we stayed was rather interior and was bordering a Wildlife Sanctuary. Grizzled Giant Squirrel - (Ratufa Macroura) ================================= The grizzled giant squirrel is a large tree squirrel found in the highlands of Sri Lanka and India. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as near threatened due to habitat loss and hunting. Countries - Native - India , Sri Lanka Taxonomic Notes - There are three very distinct subspecies, with one present in India and all three present in Sri Lanka. Red List Category & Criteria - Near Threatened Justification - Listed as Near Threatened because this species is probably in significant decline due to habitat loss and hunting throughout much of its range. Range Description - This species is endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. In India it is known from only five severely fragmented locations, while it occurs more widely and less fragmented in Sri Lanka. Population - The Indian population has been estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals, and the population has been decling due to habitat loss and hunting The population of this species is considerably higher in Sri Lanka. Habitat and Ecology - It is a diurnal and arboreal species. It occurs in tropical dry deciduous and montane forests, where it is confined to the riverine habitats. It has a generation time of ~7-8 years. Major Threats- Habitat loss and degradation due to agro-industry farming, small-scale logging, selective logging, increase in human settlements, forest fire, inter-specific competition, competition from alien species, hunting for local consumption purposes, presence of domestic predators have been observed to be the major threats for this species. The grizzled giant squirrel's common name came from the grey to brown colouration highlighted with white at the top of the tail, giving it a grizzled appearance. The rest of the body varies in colour geographically and may be brown, red, grey or black, but the fur on the underside is always lighter than the back. This agile climber is adapted for life spent almost entirely in the trees, and has a very long tail for balance, broad hands for climbing and large claws for gripping branches. The ears are short, round and sometimes tufted.Music By Lohstana David from Jamendo .com\nTranscript: \nComment: It is a pleasure to hear that you liked this video and thank﻿ you so much for your visits my Dear :) Appreciate your kind words very much and blessings to you always !! \n \n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: This was a pretty cool video, but very sad as well.

Hi, Rebecca! There's a camper and the Jeep and that's the lake. That's Muska Lounge Lake. Notice how there's not people on top of people on top of people. I guess, I never showed you guys that at the other campground. Anyway, this is a nice campground. And look, grass, not dirt. The campground that we stayed at last weekend, it was all dirt. Every single campsite was dirt. Which is just crazy. So, we're getting ready to head on the road. Head on the road. We're gonna head on the road? Head on the road. Whatever. So, we just left the campground and we are headed to Oswald's Bear Ranch. They have the north, I think the largest collection of black bears, is it? Probably. Largest collection of black bears in the United States. Or at least like on this side of the United States. Cause we were at a black bear ranch one time out west and they had a lot of bears too. I think they had a large collection of bears though, not just black bears. Yeah, I think they had like grizzly bears. Yeah, they had a Kodiak. I remember that. And this guy just has just black bears. So, we're gonna go see some bears. Not you girls. You girls are gonna have to sit in the car with the air conditioner on for a little bit. That's why we have two sets of keys. We're at the bear ranch. There's their dens. And way back there we see a bear. These are the female bears, I believe. There's a big bear right there. Just a walking. They just remind me of dogs. Imagine what it sounds like when they get all playing. Yeah. Probably like Shelby and Oakley. Yeah. Look a bear, panting just like the dogs. We don't have any apples. We didn't buy any apples yet. And don't look like he needs many apples. Pretty cool. What's up dude? What's up? Are you hot? I think these are the females he said. Yeah, and she looks like she could be pregnant. No, they're getting ready for hibernation, Jamie. Oh, that's right. Man, looks like an apple. There's that one sleeping under a tree. There's another one walking down here. I think they said there's seven in this enclosure. They have 29 all together here. Look, another bear. This one just sat down to stare at Rebecca. What do you think, Rebecca? You ever been that close to a bear? No. What are you doing, huh? Just chilling out in there? Just chilling out. She's a little smaller than the last one. Yeah, she is. Oh, look at this one. It reminds me of Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh. Kind of hanging out. Is that comfortable? Sure looks comfortable. Are you a boy? No, that's a girl. Them other ones must have been boys. Look how little she is. She's just a-walking. Looking for food. Here she goes. Looking away. Looking away. She makes a loop. And eyes. Boom. She's looking for an apple. Yeah, she wants to make sure it's not up here. Let's keep walking. We'll go find more. There's lots more. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one here's sitting up. He's like, Oh, but I wanted an apple. Those people are feeding the bears apples. So they're going to follow them all the way around. They're going to try to anyway. Uh-huh. This one's playing in the water. Didn't think he was going to. Look. King of the mountain. Yep, always balancing. He's going to lay right down in the water. Oh, I bet that feels good.

Probably stop somewhere first. I have no idea. Uh, seen? Wildlife refuge? Maybe. Maybe we'll do that on the way back for that time. Maybe. Anyway. I was just wondering why I brought this camera. So now you can clip this out. Bye. More bears. I think that was the one we just saw swimming. Oh look, he's going to climb the tree. There he goes. You can do it dude. Get it, get it, get it. It's not as little as it used to be. These are juvenile bears. They're playing back there. Want it? There's your little big truck bear. Come on. Yeah, I think he's a little big for up there.

We're leaving Oswald's Bear Ranch and now we're heading down to Newberry. That was pretty cool. If you're ever up here and you're thinking about whether or not you should stop, you should stop. Cause I had fun. Did you have fun? I had fun. Did you have fun, Rebecca? Yes, I had fun. And the dogs did well sitting in the car. We didn't leave them for too long. So, on to Newberry, I guess. It was neat to see all the bears playing. Yeah, we got some cool video we'll show you guys. And I guess if you're gonna go, you gotta go early in the morning while they're out moving around. Yeah, cause once it gets hot, they're not... They don't like to be out. Why are you in my face? Put in my face. Jamie's outside putting air in the camper tires and the Jeep tires. We got one dog. We got two dogs. We got all three dogs. There's camper. Can't see it cause the window's really dirty. There's Jamie. He just put air in the tires.

You can see all of his videos from birth onward at his Facebook page: \nTranscript: Watch this, she's grabbing a baby. I know this because she's moved one already. I was out here. Oh, here it goes. She's got a baby in her mouth. Look at that. It's not something you get to see every day. Mama squirrel has a baby. She's just taking it with her. I just ran inside to get the camera so I could get this. Oh, there's a nest right above my head there. There's one up there already. So now I know she has two babies. And I guess she decided that that nest is a better place than the box. And I have a feeling why. I wasn't leaving her alone. I put a bowl of food up there thinking I was doing her a favor. But now I realize that she doesn't want her babies near food. Because the food not only doesn't draw other squirrels, which would be a problem, but it draws other animals. So I made a mistake. I basically kicked her out of the nest box by giving her some food. So I learned something. She has another baby in her mouth right there. I don't know if it's on camera, but I can see it and I don't know where she's going with it. Oh, there's another nest. Look at that. She's just nest hopping with her babies. That's interesting. Well, so far I've seen two babies. That's one. And here she goes. Where did she go? Where'd you go, Mama Bear? There you are. Interesting. Oh, no, she's got a baby again. Look at that. She's trying out different nests. That is the craziest thing. I have never seen a squirrel moving a baby. There she is. She's going back. She's moving it back now. I don't believe it. She's putting it back. And it's just in her mouth and it's not crying or screaming or anything. Now she's putting it back. I don't believe it. I guess the nests weren't good enough. Okay. So now there's one baby back in the wooden box. I suspect she's going to come back here and grab the second one. That is crazy. Here she comes. She just popped out of the box and she's going to come back to where I am and grab the other baby. I know this because I saw her bring it over here. Hey, mama. Now she's going to go up to that nest straight up and get a baby. And I am going to show. Wouldn't it be interesting if these babies were nibblers? Obviously, there's no way to tell such a thing, but that would be cool. There she is. She's at the nest now. I can't tell because I'm looking straight up. I can't tell if the camera can see this. Okay, she's grabbed the baby. And it's in her mouth. Alright, here she comes. Oh my gosh, she's right in front of me. Hey sweetie, it's okay. Go on. Oh, and the baby's just hanging there. Oh, it's so cute. That is so cute. Alright, two babies safe in the box. I'll remember next time. I'm not going to put food up there anymore. Hopefully she keeps them there.

Sure enough, we look out, there's two little earsy spots and I just sit down and enough time for this dog to stand up, we lay on the calls and this dog comes sprinting in. Alright, ready? I'm ready. You ready for this? I'm ready. Ready. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Woo! Woo! Woo! Alright, I'm just going to stick with that saying, you hunt enough, you're going to miss them once in a while. I could go on with a list of how the bipod got in the way, Andy was yelling at me and making me panic. A coyote 8 yards with a scope of five powers, just too much, but I didn't want to start the season like this, but this footage was just phenomenal. The mojo brought him right in, the calls brought him right in, and this whole trip to Colorado was amazing. Unfortunately, I missed the dog, that stuff happens.\nComment: That's not too bad! Thanksgiving day 3 years ago I called in my first triple. All running up through the revine of the woods heading right by me! Had my AR with 3x scope. Couldn't stop any of them. But at like 20 yards I shoot twice! They keep running right past me! Missed didn't hit none! So I hit the pup in distress. Unbelievable here comes 2 more from the same as the last 3. Again same thing. Missed shot right over them! The first and last time I will probably ever call that many dogs! "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

She was found chained to a wall in a drug house during a law enforcement raid in Tennessee. Because she'd been confined to live on a concrete floor, she had huge swollen masses on her elbows that took months to heal, and was severely underweight. As you can see, she's made a full recovery since being rescued and is now the largest lion we have at the sanctuary, even bigger than our male lions Joseph and Cameron. Because she's such a big girl who just loves to frolic, run around and play, we wanted to provide Nikita with a large addition to her enclosure that she'd be able to explore and enjoy. Big Cat Rescue is situated on 55 acres in Tampa, Florida, and we're home to over 100 rescued exotic cats that were previously unwanted, abandoned or abused. The sanctuary seeks to provide the very best home we can for the cats in our care, and educate the public about the plight of these magnificent animals. The cats' enclosures are created to provide as natural an environment as possible, including trees for our leopards, who love to climb, pools for the tigers, so they can cool off, and even fresh sand for our sand cats to enjoy. So with Nikita in mind, and our goal set in place, we put our Big Cat plan into action. We wanted Nikita's new habitat to include an additional 3,500 square feet. So we needed to build an enclosure addition that measured 50 feet by 70 feet in size, at a cost of approximately $20,000. We put the word out to our supporters, and they definitely roared into action. Big Cat Rescue is fortunate to have supporters around the world who not only enable us to provide for the well-being of the cats, but also that of the sanctuary's fiscal sustainability. Lawrence and Pamela Tristle are two long-time supporters who generously donated half the cost to build Nikita's enclosure expansion as a matching grant, and hundreds of other supporters responded to help meet our goal. The first thing we had to do was make room for the addition, which meant lots of trimming, weeding, root removal, and leveling of the ground. Thanks to volunteers from the U.S. Army Citrus Park Recruiting Station here in Tampa, and of course, Big Cat Rescue volunteers, this was accomplished in record time, while Nikita kept busy watching over all involved. The perimeter of Nikita's new addition was marked out, and construction began. The walls of the enclosure were to be 15 feet in height, with a 5-foot cantilever, making the total height of the enclosure approximately 18 feet. Once all of the posts were in place, over 50 panels were hung, reinforced, cut to size, and then fixed in place. This process took almost three weeks to complete, and I'm sure Nikita was feeling a little sympathetic towards the workers. Then, the big day arrived. The Big Cat transformation was complete. Donors, volunteers, interns, and staff members alike all turned out to see Nikita take her first steps in her new territory. Everything was in place, including Nikita's favorite big yellow boomer ball, as well as a paper mache warthog for her to make friends with. Nikita was definitely ready to explore, while everybody eagerly looked on, and she didn't disappoint. Take a look. Big Cat Rescue would like to thank everyone who made this possible. Nikita may show her appreciation in unique ways, but thanks to our supporters, donors, and volunteers, we've truly enriched the life of this big girl.\nComment: Go to BigCatRescue. org and click on the navigation menu item \"Get Involved\" then click on the big blue button that says \"Volunteer\"."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

BCR staff managed to net Bellona, she was treated for injuries at Florida Veterinary Specialists and has been under the care of BCR staff ever since.Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, this week's podcast is an update on, it's an update on Bellina the bobcat. She was hit by a car a few weeks back, and if you wonder why I'm kind of talking low, well right behind me, a few acres back, that's our rehab area, and that's where Bellina and any other rehab bobcats we might get live before they're released, and she's going to go there. It's a very naturalistic enclosure. There's lots of places for her to hide. We have her, her enclosure's a little bit set up for handicapped animals, did just have all that surgery on her leg, so it enables her to get around. So even though Bellina looks a little bit freaked out right now, she's running up and down the side of the closure. That's actually a good sign for us. It means she doesn't want to be caged up. She wants to get out of captivity, and the good thing about our rehab area, it's a very quiet area. It's nice and isolated, so she's going to be able to peacefully recover from her surgery back there. She'll sort of relearn how to hunt with her repaired leg, and really, even though she's stressed out right now, or she seems stressed out, she's going to have a good, quiet recovery, and there's no way she's going to get accustomed to people. So in the rehab bobcat cage, we have a way to feed them remotely, so we can put the prey animals, which are usually live rats, we can put them in these tubes, and the tubes have several different splits, and they can end up popping up in any area of the cage, and we have this enclosure completely covered with old trees, logs, brush, a lot of places for the prey animal to hide, as well as for the bobcat to hide, so they really have to fine-tune their senses, watch out for these prey animals, and really, it gets them ready for release back into the wild. She's still being fed dead prey right now, but in a couple weeks, we'll be able to feed live prey through the tubes, so she'll be able to relearn how to hunt, relearn how to use that repaired leg. You might wonder how we are aware of the progress of our rehab bobcats, and actually, what we do is we have several remote cameras back there, so we can watch the rehab enclosure from all angles, and we never have people around the enclosure. This really gives us a great idea of how well the animal is hunting, if it's hunting, and really, how ready it is for release. It's pretty amazing, and we're keeping our fingers crossed that real soon, come spring, when there's lots of prey animals out there, she'll be healthy and healed, and we can release her back like we have the previous ones.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: i freaking love him"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five.

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets.

In this miraculous story of compassion, Captain Quinn saves the baby birds.\nTranscript: Captain Quinn here. Saving baby birds. Yeah, that's right. Woodpecker, to be exact. Baby woodpeckers. Flickers, to be even more specific. So about a week ago, I was building this chicken coop here, which happens to be crookeder than a witch's nose, but we won't get hung up on that. The chickens don't care. And I noticed this rotten old birch tree, and it was a complete safety hazard. So I pushed it over with my muscles, and when it hit the ground, it exploded right in the center. And I heard, squawk, squawk, squawk! And I looked, and there were seven baby woodpeckers. So I felt terrible, decided I had to do something. You know, like, they have just as much a right to be here as I do. So I gathered them all up in my warm embrace, put them in a shoebox, kept them warm in a dark place, and then did a little research, called an animal rescue helpline, and found out that I can either feed them a diluted mixture of cat food and plain yogurt every half an hour. Well, that's not going to happen. Or I can drive them the two and a half hours to the closest animal rescue shelter. That's also not going to happen. Or, their best chance at survival is to actually put them back in their nest, and put that nest back to where it originally was, so the parents can find them. You see, birds have a very poor sense of smell, but they have a very, very strong bond between the parents and the offspring, just like every other animal, which is pretty powerful, a bond that can't be broken easily. So I decided to reconstruct their nest, put them back in, hoist them back up to roughly the same spot, and see if the parents would come back. The problem was, the nest was in shatters, about 50 different pieces. But, I'm a crafty man, so I grabbed all the pieces, a few screws, hammered the screws into the old rotten tree, and duct taped around it with this clear duct tape, packing tape I think, and put the little critters back in, and tied a rope around the top of the rotten snag, and hoisted her back up, and waited. 15 minutes later, to my delight, one of the parents came back, and went right back in the little hole, and fed their little, you know, their offspring, the little babies. I've been observing these birds for about a week now, and it's pretty magnificent. About every 10 to 20 minutes, one of the parents, the mom or the dad, come back with food. They feed the little youngsters, and then they clean up the nest. They fly out, they're busy, they're at it all day. And it's been very cool getting to watch that. Pretty exciting. And they don't mind having chickens as neighbors, and they don't mind me as a spectator. So, it's been pretty cool. And it's been about a week. They've feathered up, and I check on them every day. They come over here to their home, and I, you know, I just tell them, you know, how are you guys doing? And as you can hear, they're quite little chatterboxes. There's a little hole in here I left so I could peek on them, see how they're doing. They're getting feathers. How are you guys doing? When are you planning on leaving the nest? Huh? Huh? About that time, I think. Oh, hi! I'm now, for scientific purposes, so we can get a better understanding of what exactly goes down in a woodpecker's nest, going to stick the pecker cam down inside Woody Woodpecker's hole. No, this is not a colonoscopy. See, woodpeckers, unlike other birds, have their nests inside hollow, rotten trees. I think, I'm not exactly sure what their plan is here. I don't know if they're going to peck their way out of there or climb up and jump. I'm not sure, but I'll keep you posted on that. But I just thought that, you know, if I can save a baby bird, then so can you. And sometimes, as we are being human and doing human things, we put the lives of animals at risk, and I think that we need to remember that they have a right to be here, just as much, if not more so, than us. So if we do find ourselves in a position where we have jeopardized the life of another living animal, I think we should do everything we can to save it and protect it. I'm Captain Quinn, and that's how to save a baby bird. See you next time. Don't forget to subscribe and tell your friends.\nComment: I can kill an animal to eat it but I won't kill for fun or sport. I respect life and would do what I can to save it but my family is also needs to eat. Wolves kill only what they eat and no more. Cats kill for the fun. We need to be more like Wolves then cats."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This video was taken immediately following the charge and shows the aftermath of the mauling that never happened.\nTranscript: Okay, we're on Montague Island out of Port Chalmers and we're hiking up the mountain. We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around.\nComment: As I'm sure you found out. Once you spray that stuff you need to be real careful. I see that you put rubber gloves on. If you get any of that spray on your hands and rub your eyes boy does it burn! I pepper sprayed a black bear in our carport this summer and some of the overspray got on the handlebars of my wifes bike. Had to scrub hard with soapy water to get it all off. Glad I noticed it before she did."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old. River Otters was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro / South Florida 2014.\nTranscript: ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪\nComment: Awww!

Finally breaking the camera out again and decided to walk some land in search of sheds, enjoy!\nTranscript: Hey guys, what's up? It's Champlea7. I know I haven't made a video in a super long time, but my camera is actually out of commission right now. I left it at my buddy's house and I haven't seen him for about two months. I went on a hog hunt with him, so I'm using my buddy, the Texas Bone Hunters video camera. And I'm back here on a wildlife management area today near my house in Dallas, Texas. It's about 15 minutes from my house and there's got to be a couple thousand acres back here I'm thinking. I mean, there is just a ton of land to come in here and I mean, I'm kind of just trail hopping right now. I'm doing a shed hunting video today. It's January the 27th or the 28th, one of the two days, Saturday, but I'm back here ready to find some sheds, hopefully bring you guys a quality video, so stay tuned. Well, guys, I know you're probably watching this video to get a couple of shed hunting information from me, so I'm going to share some with you right now, guys. First thing, this is a really new area to me. I really haven't come back here a lot. I've come back here to do a little bit of bow fishing. You might have seen some of my bow fishing videos, but I noticed a lot of the land that was back from where I bow fish is a wildlife management area, so that's why I'm in here today. This is really my first time in here and what you want to do, you really want to pick apart your cover whenever you're shed hunting. Look for any sort of geographic region that might hold deer more, like openings within some really heavily wooded forests. Look for a sign. Keep away from those areas that are devoid of signs. Try not to trail hop. I'm really guilty of doing that a lot. I do get lucky sometimes trail hopping, but you could probably find a lot more if you look for a sign. I've got a rub right here in front of me. These deer in Texas actually rut around late December into January, so I know that this is probably kind of fresh and there's some deer hanging around here, but I know a lot of bucks still haven't shed right now, especially here in the Lone Star State because we're so far south. It's really not a hard winter on these deer, so I'm really looking for older sheds maybe. Just anything that might be in here. There's a ton of woods. There's no way someone's covered at all, so I'm going to try to get a couple finds. So stick around. Hey guys, the Texas bone hunter is over here. He's found some bone. Let's see what he's got. He's probably already picked it up here. Man, this is some thick stuff. I can't believe deer are walking through here. Yeah, I know. That is a very nice shed. Was it laying right there? Well, yeah. I mean, it's not even chewed up or anything, dude. Yeah. That's an awesome shed. It's all... Yeah, it's in very good condition. Very good condition. I don't know how long I've been wanting to find a shed for myself, dude, now. Yeah? I'm so pumped. So it was right here, huh? Yeah. Wow. Very nice. Well guys, just found this bad boy right here. Little boar, it looks like. Pretty good cutters on him, actually. This spot of the woods back here is definitely dominated by pigs. You can just tell it's all tore up in here and pigs everywhere. But I found the bottom skull and then found the top skull not even 5 or 10 yards away from it. Pretty easy find and a pretty cool thing to add to my collection. So we're starting to hit some bone here now, whether it be skull or actual sheds. We'll keep in tune, guys, so stay with us. Hey guys, just found my first antler here. I haven't even gone to pick it up yet. I'm going to do an ATL picture of it with my phone and on the camera. But I am excited. It looks really good. I'm about 15 yards away from it right now. So let's go see it. Oh man. Wow, that's a good shed. Ha. Guys, we're on some wildlife management area land here. In Texas. And by God, he's got a split brow. It's pretty nice. A G2 and G3 and he's pretty chunky for being back here. Man. Well, that's awesome. I'm glad we got one, guys. I'm ready to go find some more. Oh my God. Wow. Alright. I ain't kidding you guys right now. I just want to do a walking away shot with this shed. And there's another shed not even laying 10 yards away. Right on the same trail. Looks to be pretty old. So there's some more. Shed's obviously to be found. Keep watching, guys. Wow. Alright, guys. What I'm doing now is what's called gridding. After finding those two antlers, there's a pretty good chance that the other one's going to be pretty close by. So what you want to do is wherever you found that antler, just kind of go back and forth. Help you use landmarks. And trying to find the other side. Basically making a big sweep where you can't miss it. You're not trail hopping. You're doing more of a systematic search. So stay with me. And I'll check in if I get anything. Thanks for watching!\nComment: very nice bud, very nice.  Hopefully we will find the other matches!!!! keep up the work!!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not. But kind of like a\nComment: I saw her yesterday "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five. I'm Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism.\nComment: We live in a sick evil society, and these cowardly bully Sociopaths are the sickest ones of all. People who like to hurt harmless animals for fun are psychos and losers. They should be institutionalized because these are the same creeps who end up shooting human beings.

As rabbits are fast moving, quick-turning, and ten times bigger, the slim-lined stoats must develop their hunting skills early to stand any chance of catching these relative giants. Despite their small size and short legs, stoats can carry on going where their prey might start flagging.Life | Episode 7 | BBC#bbcAll our TV channels and S4C are available to watch live through BBC iPlayer, although some programmes may not be available to stream online due to rights.

FAQ ???? \nTranscript: This stoat is about to take on an adversary ten times its size. It's too dangerous to rush straight in. Instead, the stoat's aim is to wear the rabbit down. The rabbit is flagging, and the stoat's stamina is starting to make a difference. But stamina alone is not enough. The rabbit must still be overpowered. A bite to the back of the neck, and a kill. The incredible agility of the stoat, practised since it was a kit, was just enough to swing the balance.\nComment: This is why I protect my rabbit at all costs!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Red-tailed Hawks are most often seen soaring high above the ground, looking for food. They are very difficult to identify unless they come closer to the earth.Red-tailed Hawks are large, stocky birds. They are brown with a white breast and a rust-colored tail.This hawk soars very high in the sky, hunting for food. They have excellent eyesight which is much sharper than a human's. A Red-tailed Hawk can spot a mouse from a height of 100 feet.These hawks also hunt from perches, usually alongside a field. Most of their prey are small mammals, including: mice, voles, shrews, moles, squirrels, chipmunks, rats, rabbits, opossums, muskrats, cats, skunks, and bats.music by Jason Shaw   Artist: AUDIONAUTIX.COM   Title: SERENITY\nTranscript: You You You Pretty That's something he's eating And roses ripping it apart I'm pretty big to what he caught Tail is hanging across the post These ripping pieces out of it Why I'd like to know what it caught because it's a pretty good sized thing I was throwing its guts out Doesn't like the guts He's getting big chunks now, oh that's taste good Oh Geez holy smokes It just about ate half the critter that it got.

The cats' efforts were captured by high-definition and slow-motion cameras for the Saving a Species series for teachers.Subscribe to our channel on YouTube:  to our print magazine:  our Blog:  us on Twitter:  a fan on Facebook:  our TV show: \nTranscript: Today we're shooting an episode of Shamu TV. It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection. It's just something that we've been doing for a long time. We're very passionate about our care for animals and we want to share that with everyone.\nComment: \"The Cheetah is the fastest land animal.

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: And this is the work of the master builder among bower birds. I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: This is truly amazing. Such small bird.. wow."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

And to reaffirm despite many finding it hard this dominance displayed by the dogs reflects just how group mentality allowed us to reach a stage today when we don't have to sit around at night by the fire watching the perimeter with the fear that a wildcat would attack."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Fascinating insight into the private life of these colourful birds from BBC wildlife show 'Jungle'.This is a channel from BBC Studios who help fund new BBC programmes. Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: For hornbills, finding the right tree is crucial to survival. They need a roomy nesting hole, usually made when a large branch falls off a mature tree, which doesn't happen very often. Scientists have installed surveillance cameras into nest holes like this, to get an intimate, kind of big-brother view into the private lives of hornbills. These unique pictures show a female hornbill making herself at home. She needs to feel as comfortable as possible, because she's going to be a prisoner in here for up to four months. Once in, she starts preparing to seal up the door. She's plugging the entrance with mud, pieces of wood and sticky fruit, and leaving just a very narrow slit. And the reason why she shuts herself away is to lay her egg and protect her chick. From now on, she'll depend entirely on her partner to survive. He makes about ten or more runs a day, bringing back about a kilogram of food, a varied diet of fruit, insects, small reptiles and young birds. He stores it in his throat, and once back at the nest, regurgitates it for his family. With such intensive care, the chick grows fast, and eats mum out of house and home. After five weeks, there's only room inside the hole for him. Once a pair have found their ideal home, they'll keep on coming back for years. So trees like this are critical to the survival of these endangered birds. If this nest isn't available next year, this chick's parents may never find another.\nComment: .... I wonder if it would be possible to build a nest for the Horn Bill and would the birds use them.........We might be able to attract the birds with plenty of food and water and their own credit card. We live in the mangroves located about 2 or 3 hours by motobike and boats from Koh Kong Cambodia. There are flocks of Horn Bill birds here. I have no idea where they roost at night. Maybe a hotel...............If the chicks grow up in a home made birds nest, they might return next season."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

There was a lot of blood on the ground, so the team was worried the deer might be injured.When they finally caught him, they discovered that the blood was from his hooves and not from a fresh wound. They released him in a field nearby, after draining all the energy out of Lucy, the vet nurse!SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL WITH US!Google+ ►  ►  ►  ►  TheWildlifeAid TV...Ever wanted to see the goings on behind the scenes at a Wildlife Rescue Centre?

So click subscribe to keep up to date with our new videos uploaded almost every day!\nTranscript: Good morning. We've just arrived at the school playground where there's an adult male roe deer unable to get out. There's a lot of blood on the ground, we're not sure whether it's because he's been running on the concrete or he's got an injury. Because he's down we're going to try to see if we can get to a point where we can get this little jab stick over him and get it into him because we know he'll then go to sleep very quickly. But it's not the easiest thing and they usually don't stand it, but it will save us having to try to catch him. Right, that was the end of that one. Absolutely screwed the needle. Okay, didn't work people. He's quite calm at the moment, but he could so easily jump over that fence just back and forth. Sean's got him really well contained, he's just very steady behind him keeping him calm. But we don't know where he's going to go from. Well, that was a much more sedate rescue than it might have been. The wound on his flank is very old, he's done it a long time ago. We can put a bit of gel on that and maybe give him an antibiotic. It's really old, it's healed. We just need to see where all this blood's coming from. I think the blood's from his hooves. These have bled and you can see where he's gone backwards and forwards across that end part. He's got a cut on either eye as well. That's old. This side's not quite so old. He's been in the wars a bit. He has. These are all really old injuries, they're completely dry. I've got the antlers protected so he can't do you any damage, will he? OK, I'm ready. OK, let's go on. Come on, fella. Steady. Get Lucy's expression well, Andy. No, don't. OK, we good? Well, the deer's here. Didn't have to walk very far. I'm not sure whether Lucy's ever going to walk again. She looks absolutely knackered. But he's ready to go. He's gorgeous. Straight into woodland from this field. He shouldn't go back towards the school, so he's on his own again for his second chance. We're looking at him probably as third or fourth chance, to be honest. Right, OK. And off you go, fella. Relaxed, wasn't he? He's really looking good. Just toddling off at his own pace, really. I'm in no rush. I'm back home. She's actually had five minutes to recover. But you can tell how unfit our vet nurse is, can't you? She might be good at her job. Get her to walk 200 yards and she's... Look at it. You're so naughty. If I hadn't had what I had, you'd have got an antler in the face.\nComment: So basically... that's the Rambo of the roe deer world you caught there- All scared up but still going strong like a true fighter :P And I hope you gave Lucy some IV fluids after that, she looks like she needed it. And she is far too good to loose so keep her alive will you ;)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

BCR staff managed to net Bellona, she was treated for injuries at Florida Veterinary Specialists and has been under the care of BCR staff ever since.Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, this week's podcast is an update on, it's an update on Bellina the bobcat. She was hit by a car a few weeks back, and if you wonder why I'm kind of talking low, well right behind me, a few acres back, that's our rehab area, and that's where Bellina and any other rehab bobcats we might get live before they're released, and she's going to go there. It's a very naturalistic enclosure. There's lots of places for her to hide. We have her, her enclosure's a little bit set up for handicapped animals, did just have all that surgery on her leg, so it enables her to get around. So even though Bellina looks a little bit freaked out right now, she's running up and down the side of the closure. That's actually a good sign for us. It means she doesn't want to be caged up. She wants to get out of captivity, and the good thing about our rehab area, it's a very quiet area. It's nice and isolated, so she's going to be able to peacefully recover from her surgery back there. She'll sort of relearn how to hunt with her repaired leg, and really, even though she's stressed out right now, or she seems stressed out, she's going to have a good, quiet recovery, and there's no way she's going to get accustomed to people. So in the rehab bobcat cage, we have a way to feed them remotely, so we can put the prey animals, which are usually live rats, we can put them in these tubes, and the tubes have several different splits, and they can end up popping up in any area of the cage, and we have this enclosure completely covered with old trees, logs, brush, a lot of places for the prey animal to hide, as well as for the bobcat to hide, so they really have to fine-tune their senses, watch out for these prey animals, and really, it gets them ready for release back into the wild. She's still being fed dead prey right now, but in a couple weeks, we'll be able to feed live prey through the tubes, so she'll be able to relearn how to hunt, relearn how to use that repaired leg. You might wonder how we are aware of the progress of our rehab bobcats, and actually, what we do is we have several remote cameras back there, so we can watch the rehab enclosure from all angles, and we never have people around the enclosure. This really gives us a great idea of how well the animal is hunting, if it's hunting, and really, how ready it is for release. It's pretty amazing, and we're keeping our fingers crossed that real soon, come spring, when there's lots of prey animals out there, she'll be healthy and healed, and we can release her back like we have the previous ones.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: She keeps eating like that, She will set off a mine from getting to fat :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

I just ran inside to get the camera so I could get this. Oh, there's a nest right above my head there. There's one up there already. So now I know she has two babies. And I guess she decided that that nest is a better place than the box. And I have a feeling why. I wasn't leaving her alone. I put a bowl of food up there thinking I was doing her a favor. But now I realize that she doesn't want her babies near food. Because the food not only doesn't draw other squirrels, which would be a problem, but it draws other animals. So I made a mistake. I basically kicked her out of the nest box by giving her some food. So I learned something. She has another baby in her mouth right there. I don't know if it's on camera, but I can see it and I don't know where she's going with it. Oh, there's another nest. Look at that. She's just nest hopping with her babies. That's interesting. Well, so far I've seen two babies. That's one. And here she goes. Where did she go? Where'd you go, Mama Bear? There you are. Interesting. Oh, no, she's got a baby again. Look at that. She's trying out different nests. That is the craziest thing. I have never seen a squirrel moving a baby. There she is. She's going back. She's moving it back now. I don't believe it. She's putting it back. And it's just in her mouth and it's not crying or screaming or anything. Now she's putting it back. I don't believe it. I guess the nests weren't good enough. Okay. So now there's one baby back in the wooden box. I suspect she's going to come back here and grab the second one. That is crazy. Here she comes. She just popped out of the box and she's going to come back to where I am and grab the other baby. I know this because I saw her bring it over here. Hey, mama. Now she's going to go up to that nest straight up and get a baby. And I am going to show. Wouldn't it be interesting if these babies were nibblers? Obviously, there's no way to tell such a thing, but that would be cool. There she is. She's at the nest now. I can't tell because I'm looking straight up. I can't tell if the camera can see this. Okay, she's grabbed the baby. And it's in her mouth. Alright, here she comes. Oh my gosh, she's right in front of me. Hey sweetie, it's okay. Go on. Oh, and the baby's just hanging there. Oh, it's so cute. That is so cute. Alright, two babies safe in the box. I'll remember next time. I'm not going to put food up there anymore. Hopefully she keeps them there. Maybe I can tame up another pair of squirrels. That would be so neat.\nComment: \"she didnt like that the babies were near food.\" and what did we learn? do not interfere with the animals. do not feed them. do not help."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Top 3 Most Memorable Wild Animal Experiences Spawned from a viewer comment, I discuss 2 (actually 3) of my most memorable animal experiences while in the backcountry. And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: Very interesting, thank you."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: Thanks for this information.

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: this make me so sad that people do this "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The best part about it is the fact that it isn't some invented marketing ploy. It's the one and only cleaner wildlife experts have been using to clean animals' cotton oil spills for more than 30 years. Why? Because Dawn is tough enough to cut through grease, even natural disaster-type grease, while being gentle enough to clean the delicate skins of these animals, as you can see in our national TV commercial. Wildlife rescue workers open up a lot of Dawn, tough on grease, yet gentle. Dawn helps open something even bigger. This year, Dawn is also donating $1 million. Learn more at Dawn Saves Wildlife. The centerpiece of our effort was a nine-part documentary series, The Big Picture, shown only online. The series showed the everyday threats to wildlife and explained what people could do about it. The Big Picture could be seen on dawnsaveswildlife.com and YouTube. Pelicans are one of California's big success stories. They just came off the endangered species list in 2009. They're thriving despite all of these issues that they're still having to deal with. Pelicans are prehistoric creatures. This is an animal that's evolved over time and is specific for plunge-feeding fish. When people feed them, they stop doing what they do naturally and start looking in the dumpsters. What happens with that is they become dirty. The biggest problem that it causes is it contaminates their feathers. And that ability to be waterproof, it can make them hypothetical. At the end of the day, they have to be cleaned. We have the product that does it, and it works better than anything. Dawn. Paid media drove people to the micro-site.

The 800,000-acre Twin Peaks Herd Management Area lies along the California-Nevada border northeast of Susanville.\nTranscript: Hi, I'm standing in the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area in Northern California. This is the largest wild horse and burrow management area in BLM California. This summer we're planning a gather to bring in excess horses and burrows because we have too many on the range right now and it's not healthy for either the horses, the burrows or the range that they live on. We manage for a lot of uses out here. Horses and burrows are one of them, as well as cattle and public recreation. So it's important to make sure that we balance all of these uses and make sure that we're taking care of the land we're charged to manage. Today we're going to take you around and show you some of the herd management area. We'll show you some of the areas where the horses and the burrows like to live, where they range, what they eat. We might even be able to see horses and burrows today, that's our plan. Straddling the Nevada-California border about 120 miles north of Reno, Nevada, this rugged high desert landscape provides important habitat for wild horses and burrows and wildlife. It also provides forage for domestic livestock grazing that is an important part of local economies. The appropriate management level for the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area is 448 to 758 wild horses and 72 to 116 wild burrows. The current populations are estimated at 2,300 wild horses, about five times the appropriate management level, and 280 wild burrows, about two times the appropriate management level. At almost 800,000 acres, the region is vast, but its resources limited. In fact, many parts of this rugged-looking landscape are fragile and require careful management. We're standing here on the edge of the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area. I wanted to show you the perennial grasses that are out here and explain a little bit as to why they're important. So before me is some crested wheatgrass and you'll see that it's critical. It's good forage for wild horses and burrows. It also serves as thermal cover for a lot of the smaller species that we have, birds and lizards and things like that. It serves also a purpose of keeping the soil in place. It helps to bind the soil particles together through the root system and also shield the soil particles from raindrop impact. In this part of the HMA, things are higher in elevation, so we end up with more production. These perennial grasses that you see behind me are plentiful and can provide more forage per acre, whereas other parts of the HMA are lower elevation and you end up with approximately 30 acres per one horse a month. We'll show you that a little later when we get to one of those spots. So here we are in the lower elevation area of the Twin Peaks HMA, and while it certainly is beautiful, looks can be deceiving. This area here would take about 30 football fields, or 30 acres, to support one horse per month. It comes out to be a lot of country when you consider we want about 500 horses in the HMA. There are other uses out here as well, such as pronghorn, mule deer, and permitted livestock grazing. The horses and burros are healthy, and much of the range appears to be healthy as well. A closer look, however, reveals that some areas are showing signs of stress, requiring management actions, including reducing the wild horse herd. Limited water and the need to keep water sources healthy are the primary management concerns in Twin Peaks. So we're at Painter Creek now, and this is an area that we would call functioning at risk during our riparian assessments. Some of the indicators here as to why things are not properly functioning. You can see the slough banks here. This is due to trampling from livestock and horses when they come down in. If the right type of riparian vegetation isn't here, and the root system isn't stable enough to hold the soil in place, you'll actually get it sloughing off, destabilizing the banks, and then also causing a decrease in water quality. So there are several reasons why we want to keep riparian areas from becoming this degraded, and why we want to see them in proper functioning condition and not functioning at risk. That includes for the health of the wildlife that use the area, as well as the health of the Twin Peaks horse herd. It's important to keep this water system available and functioning year-round, since water is such a limiting factor in these arid environments. So this is an example of a properly functioning riparian area. Some of the indicators that you would look for would be riparian species covering the banks, which is what you see here, aquatic vegetation throughout the stream channel, clear water that can support wildlife, such as the fish and the minnows that you see in the creek behind us, as well as stabilized makes. Visited during spring, much of the Twin Peaks area appears vibrant and green, but this situation changes over the course of the summer. Hot weather and the lack of rain reduce the amount of forage available for range animals, including wild horses and burros. To keep ranges healthy, the BLM must balance uses at sustainable levels. Livestock are managed in specific areas and allowed on the range for designated grazing seasons. In response to resource conditions, the BLM and ranchers have reduced livestock numbers by about 50% compared to 30 years ago. Wild horses and burros use the range all year, therefore, herd populations must be maintained at sustainable levels. Balancing uses is part of the BLM's multiple-use mandate and responsibility on the public lands. Wild horses are an integral part and an important part of that diversity that's found out on the ranges. However, if their numbers are allowed to increase without management, then eventually it will come to damage not only the resources and the other uses on the ranges, but the wild horses themselves. Twin Peaks has always had the ability to carry some horses. When numbers get very, very high, you can really run into problems. What in effect happens is that more animals end up being at risk and there can be a set up for catastrophic losses, either from a long-term drought or heavy snow. You know, we're proud of the fact that we have healthy wild horses and burros on the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area. It's important to us to be proactive and make sure that we keep the horses and burros within an appropriate management level. Therefore, we come out and every few years we have to remove the excess horses and burros, and that helps us ensure that the horses and burros remain healthy, as well as the rangelands that they like to roam on. The wild horses and burros that we remove off the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area all go to good homes. Some of them are adopted out, they're very popular for their size and their health, and some of them go to long-term pastures. It's important to BLM that these wild horses and burros do end up in good homes or in the long-term pastures where they can spend the rest of their lives. As public land managers, our job is to manage wild horses and burros on the range, to keep both the horses and burros healthy, as well as the rangelands. And we welcome and encourage your involvement in that work. It takes all of us together to make sure that we're doing the right thing by the horses and the burros and the land.\nComment: But do you understand that little is paid for the cattle on the range and the cattle also are eating the food on the range which the cattlemen make money on?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They have that mud on their back to help them as like a sunscreen and a mosquito repellent. They actually can't see really well. But Robert, what can they do? They have really, really good hearing. And what's funny about Kai is if you look just on his ears, he's got those little tufts of fur. Isn't that silly? We're not really sure why he has it. Maybe it's to keep the dust out of his ears. This is the white rhino. And they're different from their cousin, the black rhino, for a few different reasons. Firstly, these guys are grazers. So if you look at their mouth, they have that real rectangular shape and really big squishy lips. That's because they eat things like grass. But if you compare them to their cousin, the black rhino, they have a more triangular shaped mouth, don't they? Yeah. It's really pointy. And do you know why they have that? That's because they eat different foods. It's true. So they eat more like things like shrubs. Yeah, so rhinos can actually grow up to be two tons. They're really, really heavy. It's true. Now, the poor rhinos are in a lot of trouble. They're actually critically endangered because of that gorgeous horn. That horn is made out of keratin, which is the same as our fingernails. What people do is they'll kill the rhinos for that horn to turn it into traditional medicine. The biggest thing to protect rhinos or any wildlife is to never, ever buy wildlife products.

Hare sheep is what they are, get away from rabbits for a little bit. Anyway, these are the hare sheep, here comes Shelby, she's an Anatolian Marema Lifestyle Guardian dog and she's just a little bit over a year old. She keeps the sheep safe in here, come here Shelby, come here girl, good girl. We used to lose sheep to the coyotes out here and ever since we got her, come here Shelby, come girl, she's really kept an eye out on them. It's real fun to watch her because right about 4 in the afternoon when it starts getting dark, she'll go ahead and walk the fence line. She's definitely keeping the coyotes out, they had multiple holes along the fence line. It's about 5 acres in here and it's mostly all blackberry. All this right here that's all cleared out used to look like what's over there on the other side of the fence, sheep can't get to that so that's all overgrown. That's what it looked like and this is what it looks like over here now and they still have a lot to go. Right now, they're eating some hay, some orchard grass and these hare sheep, there's a few different breeds in here and I'll go through them here. This one here that's looking back at us, she's a Catan-Dorper cross and there's a few of those. Most of all the white ones are Catan-Dorper and that guy right there in the middle, he's a breeding ram, that white one and that's one of the breeding rams and the one right next to him that's got the little horns there, he just moved, he's another breeding ram. We keep two in here and that one that just poked her head out, she's a Dorper-Barbados black belly cross and this orange one here, she's a Catan. She's an orange Catan and the breeding ram, he's a white Catan and this little one that looks like deer with the black belly, they are the purebred American Barbados black belly and that one there with the black head, she's a Blackhead-Dorper. There's two of those and they're registered and papered and everything and this little guy here in the front, little red guy there, he is a Barbados cross. We don't know what his sire was, the previous ram that we had in here, he was sired by that one and we don't know what he was anyway. He's a pretty looking, he's a weather and these two rams here, they're unrelated to all of these ewes and most of all these ewes were born in December of last year or so they're about 11 months old so they're all coming into heat now and we'll probably have some spring lambs in March so I'll probably do a video of them so look forward to that. There's two black ones in the back or the dark colored ones back there, there's two of them, they're sisters. I don't know if I can get a good shot from this side of the fence but they're Columbian Shetland cross, there she is, poked her head right in the middle of those and hair sheep you don't need to shear them, doctor tails or trim their hooves, they're very low maintenance, they're good for brush eating, for pets and for meat as well. They're gaining a lot of popularity out here in the northwest, they're very popular out in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, parts of California, Mexico and Central America and South America and down south of Mexico they call them the Pelebues, so they're nice animals to keep, they're very lean, mild taste and they are nowhere near as stinky as goats and they have very good mothering instincts, so they're easy keepers these guys, that's why we like them. Some of these have their tails docked just for the look really, usually you want to dock the tails on wool sheep because of the maggots get stuck back there, causes the animal to get sick and then die, but because these animals have hair, it's not like a horse or a cow or a dog, it's not going to get stuck back there in the wool, but we do it just for the look, I think they look nice with their tails docked, they've really done a good job of clearing this up out here. There's another breed of hair sheep, they're called St. Croix, they're from the island of St. Thomas and they're even more parasite resistant, they don't get to be as meaty, they're still pretty nice animals. And then there's a few other hair sheep, I forget what the names of the breeds are. That's the video, hope you guys enjoyed it, if you have any questions or comments, post them up, and if you haven't subscribed, subscribe, you're welcome to, and we'll catch you next time.\nComment: Nice.  Just subbed you!  We are looking at adding hair sheep here @RidgeLife.  Thanks!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The bucks are the ones with the brown on their heads - the brown is staining from tree bark as they rub their antlers on trees.  They will be snow white again when they shed their winter coats.  They are not regulars in our neck of the woods so we didn't have the opportunity to see them with their antlers.  We sure would have loved to.  We did get a brief glimpse of the old buck with his wide, palmated antlers.  It seems that as the albino bucks age their antlers get thicker & thicker.  We learned shortly after this filming that the old buck (with the limp) was taken by wolves.  They only came around a few days but we sure enjoyed seeing them.  The big buck especially, who we called Big Al, was absolutely magnificent.

Big Cat Rescue recently installed a solar power system thanks to the generous support of The Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, TECO-Tampa Electrical and Solar Energy Management. We're so happy that the sanctuary was given the opportunity to help save the planet by utilizing green energy sources and we hope to expand in the future!Check in on our solar power system here:  Energy Management:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Big Cat Rescue is going greeeeen! What? What does this mean? Oh. Big Cat Rescue decided to do our part to help save the planet by installing a solar power system. The installation was made possible by grants from the Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, and a solar electric rebate from TECO. The overall cost of the installation was $18,250. It took the team from Solar Energy Management around three days to install the system. They have to make sure that the solar panels are at the optimal angle so they can capture as much energy as possible from the sun. Throughout the installation, the team were constantly supervised by the cats. In particular, Joseph and Sasha. And, of course, TJ the tiger who was very interested in what was happening around him. For the projected 25-year life of the system, annual utility savings are expected to average around $1,542. So this will total to over $38,000 in savings. And just as importantly, carbon dioxide emissions that will be saved over the life of the system is projected at 157 tons, which is equivalent to driving 314,000 automotive miles. The sanctuary will be using the energy to power all of our pool pumps. So our tigers will have a place to cool off. Max the bobcat can take the occasional dip. And we can constantly replace the water that TJ splashes out of his pool. Plus, any excess power goes backwards through the electrical meter and is supplied to the main office building. Solar Energy Management generously donated two extra panels to the sanctuary. So instead of 20 panels, we have 22. And all 22 individual modules have their own microinverter underneath the panel. What's a microinverter, you might ask? And that's the box right here. And that's the box right here. So the advantages to the microinverter technology are if partial shading occurs or bird droppings fall on a panel and it degrades the performance of this panel, it doesn't affect any of the rest of the panels, so you can maximize power production. And the data collected by all 22 microinverters is transferred to the communication gateway, which then verifies that they're functioning and transmits the data, which is collected every five minutes, wirelessly to the main office where we can check on their status. You can actually monitor the output and production from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. On the webpage, you can check that all the panels are functioning correctly, see how much energy they've produced over different periods of time, and see the environmental benefits to date, such as how the energy could be used. And you can even see how many trees we've saved with our carbon offset. We're so pleased that we've been able to take our first step towards using green energy, thanks to the generous support of several organizations. Our solar panel system is also very easy to add on to, so we hope to do this in the future and continue to do our part for the environment. And I'm sure TJ will enjoy the entertainment.

The white sticks out, so its chances of being seen by an eagle or a python, a mongoose, a rival predator, are so much greater. The normal coloured cubs, they blend with the forest floor, the leaf litter, the dappled light in the forest, they kind of disappear. The white cub sticks out like a beacon, very very vulnerable, and its colour makes it even more vulnerable. See the white tiger there trying to suckle on the other tiger, instinctive, gets no milk so immediately starts shouting. All three cubs now gone to sleep. Clambering over these rocks has taken it out of them, all their heads going down, little yawns, eyes closing, nice warm rocks, sun dropping now, temperature dropping, and they're all off for a nice little snooze. The number of sounds that I use to communicate with the cubs, I give a little purring sound, this is what a cheetah mother uses with her cubs, see how it calms them down, and then I use the little chuffing sound. See the other cubs are responding to the purr. Today the little cubs, just a month old, have had their first experience of water, and their first swimming experience. Now of all the big cats, tigers love the water the most. They live in areas where there are big monsoon rains, big rivers, and they will swim. In fact, in the Shundabans, they will swim 15 kilometers between the islands hunting for food. Watch how Shine helps Shunda climb out of the water. This is a typical den site that a tigress will use, nice little caves, and in here she can put these little cubs, get them into the crevices, and make it difficult for a rival predator to get inside. Now every few days, she will move those cubs to a new den site. When the scent builds up, the urine, the dung inside the den, it becomes smelly, and she takes the cub and moves it to a den site that she's found somewhere nearby.\nComment: Where is the mom?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It's Great value, well camouflaged, well made, easy to put up and take down, not like the fold away dome hides at all. It's all waterproof and I was using it today in the pouring rain and didn't get wet at all ( though you will if u have the zip part of the windows down as rain gets through the mesh). All in all a very happy purchase, just hope I get some good use from it.\nTranscript: Hello, this is my review of the One Man Photography Chairhide. As you can see it's nice and camouflaged. The one-way lining is velcro strapped. So you can tear that down and have a nice little opening to point your camera out. The front zips down, so you have a nice wide opening if you want a better view. Have a look in the air for any birds of prey. But today I've been using it zipped up like this and it's worked really well. The birds can't see me at all. I've got some nice photographs of some starlings on there and a robin as well. The chairhide's got plenty of room inside. It can be pegged down, comes with a nice carry bag. The backpack fits on your back. It weighs about 5kg, which is quite heavy. But with the backpack sticking on your back it shouldn't be too bad. There's a few windows here. One there, one there. Same on the other side. We've got one-way viewing mesh, so you can see out but they can't see in. And you can velcro them down as well, so you can have the thing completely open if you like. There's also these little covers. They just zip down like that, let you see out. Well, it's one-way but from a distance. If you want to get in, just lift the front up. It's a bit of a faff one-handed, but... Alright, maybe quite a faff one-handed. There you go, you can go the same side. It is a lot easier when you've got two hands to use. It's a nice comfy chair, about the same as you get in a camp stove. Cup holder. Nice inside, easy to put up, easy to take down. Only take you a couple of minutes to put it away. Loads of room inside, you can fit your tripod in. And a camera bag as well. Really nice chair hide, this one's the Stealth Gear one. From Morris Photography for about £75. Really great value. Apart from the weight, which makes it a bit awkward to take with you everywhere you go. But if you set somewhere up, feed a station, it should work a treat.

These baby woodpeckers fell to the ground when the rotten tree that their nest was in was pushed over. In this miraculous story of compassion, Captain Quinn saves the baby birds.\nTranscript: Captain Quinn here. Saving baby birds. Yeah, that's right. Woodpecker, to be exact. Baby woodpeckers. Flickers, to be even more specific. So about a week ago, I was building this chicken coop here, which happens to be crookeder than a witch's nose, but we won't get hung up on that. The chickens don't care. And I noticed this rotten old birch tree, and it was a complete safety hazard. So I pushed it over with my muscles, and when it hit the ground, it exploded right in the center. And I heard, squawk, squawk, squawk! And I looked, and there were seven baby woodpeckers. So I felt terrible, decided I had to do something. You know, like, they have just as much a right to be here as I do. So I gathered them all up in my warm embrace, put them in a shoebox, kept them warm in a dark place, and then did a little research, called an animal rescue helpline, and found out that I can either feed them a diluted mixture of cat food and plain yogurt every half an hour. Well, that's not going to happen. Or I can drive them the two and a half hours to the closest animal rescue shelter. That's also not going to happen. Or, their best chance at survival is to actually put them back in their nest, and put that nest back to where it originally was, so the parents can find them. You see, birds have a very poor sense of smell, but they have a very, very strong bond between the parents and the offspring, just like every other animal, which is pretty powerful, a bond that can't be broken easily. So I decided to reconstruct their nest, put them back in, hoist them back up to roughly the same spot, and see if the parents would come back. The problem was, the nest was in shatters, about 50 different pieces. But, I'm a crafty man, so I grabbed all the pieces, a few screws, hammered the screws into the old rotten tree, and duct taped around it with this clear duct tape, packing tape I think, and put the little critters back in, and tied a rope around the top of the rotten snag, and hoisted her back up, and waited. 15 minutes later, to my delight, one of the parents came back, and went right back in the little hole, and fed their little, you know, their offspring, the little babies. I've been observing these birds for about a week now, and it's pretty magnificent. About every 10 to 20 minutes, one of the parents, the mom or the dad, come back with food. They feed the little youngsters, and then they clean up the nest. They fly out, they're busy, they're at it all day. And it's been very cool getting to watch that. Pretty exciting. And they don't mind having chickens as neighbors, and they don't mind me as a spectator. So, it's been pretty cool. And it's been about a week. They've feathered up, and I check on them every day. They come over here to their home, and I, you know, I just tell them, you know, how are you guys doing? And as you can hear, they're quite little chatterboxes. There's a little hole in here I left so I could peek on them, see how they're doing. They're getting feathers. How are you guys doing? When are you planning on leaving the nest? Huh? Huh? About that time, I think. Oh, hi! I'm now, for scientific purposes, so we can get a better understanding of what exactly goes down in a woodpecker's nest, going to stick the pecker cam down inside Woody Woodpecker's hole. No, this is not a colonoscopy. See, woodpeckers, unlike other birds, have their nests inside hollow, rotten trees. I think, I'm not exactly sure what their plan is here. I don't know if they're going to peck their way out of there or climb up and jump. I'm not sure, but I'll keep you posted on that. But I just thought that, you know, if I can save a baby bird, then so can you. And sometimes, as we are being human and doing human things, we put the lives of animals at risk, and I think that we need to remember that they have a right to be here, just as much, if not more so, than us. So if we do find ourselves in a position where we have jeopardized the life of another living animal, I think we should do everything we can to save it and protect it. I'm Captain Quinn, and that's how to save a baby bird. See you next time. Don't forget to subscribe and tell your friends.\nComment: Number one this is a very special occasion. I have owned birds and rescued wild birds my whole life and the parents DO in fact give up on the young when they see the chicks have fallen. They will watch the young, but without the parents the baby birds would die over night and without a nest the parents can't protect them from the cold and predators. Thank you for rebuilding the nest, just be careful and thank you!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back.

The sanctuary is a permanent home to over 100 rescued big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards. As well as smaller species like bobcats, servals, and sand cats. Campers arrive every day and get to explore our 55 acre property, making sure they say hello to the cats and taking lots of photos along the way. While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this. We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life. Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans. They get to do lots of fun activities, like making Big Cat popsicles and learning about our operant conditioning program and why it's so important to the cats at the sanctuary. Then campers observe Big Cat keepers handing out the popsicles they made and the cats willingly participating in our operant conditioning program. To find out more about Big Cat Rescue Summer Camp and to reserve your spot, please visit our website at bigcatrescue.org.\nComment: Sometimes the vets need to look at a cats belly or paws, or apply flea prevention, or give a shot.  If the cats are okay with standing up like that to get a treat or to lay down on the ground to get a treat it means the vet can do simple things without having to sedate the cat."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five. I'm Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism.\nComment: God hates what these cowards and bullies do. He will hunt them down the way they hunt down these poor innocent squirrels, he will hunt down the people who taught them these despicable deeds and destroy them. God is good and just, he loves his animal children the same as humans. He will not stand for unjust murder. God will punish this, these people are cursed all their lives and forever.

This video was taken immediately following the charge and shows the aftermath of the mauling that never happened.\nTranscript: Okay, we're on Montague Island out of Port Chalmers and we're hiking up the mountain. We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around.

It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not.

Yeah, the babies are on the grass behind the mothers. I think that might be a baby gator. The baby gators are on the grass behind you? Yeah. Are you a mama? Well, obviously that has to be a female. Well, if it was a male, there weren't any babies in there. They'd be in his tummy. Well, I can tell you how you wouldn't need to find out for sure if you wanted to want to. Anyway, mama and one little baby on the pipe. Oh, there's two babies. They're like right across from each other. It's like stereo babies. Stereo baby gators.

And she will protect her babies not only from birds and otters or whatever is coming after them. She will have to protect her babies from turtles. Come back. Relax.

She was found chained to a wall in a drug house during a law enforcement raid in Tennessee. Because she'd been confined to live on a concrete floor, she had huge swollen masses on her elbows that took months to heal, and was severely underweight. As you can see, she's made a full recovery since being rescued and is now the largest lion we have at the sanctuary, even bigger than our male lions Joseph and Cameron. Because she's such a big girl who just loves to frolic, run around and play, we wanted to provide Nikita with a large addition to her enclosure that she'd be able to explore and enjoy. Big Cat Rescue is situated on 55 acres in Tampa, Florida, and we're home to over 100 rescued exotic cats that were previously unwanted, abandoned or abused. The sanctuary seeks to provide the very best home we can for the cats in our care, and educate the public about the plight of these magnificent animals. The cats' enclosures are created to provide as natural an environment as possible, including trees for our leopards, who love to climb, pools for the tigers, so they can cool off, and even fresh sand for our sand cats to enjoy. So with Nikita in mind, and our goal set in place, we put our Big Cat plan into action. We wanted Nikita's new habitat to include an additional 3,500 square feet. So we needed to build an enclosure addition that measured 50 feet by 70 feet in size, at a cost of approximately $20,000. We put the word out to our supporters, and they definitely roared into action. Big Cat Rescue is fortunate to have supporters around the world who not only enable us to provide for the well-being of the cats, but also that of the sanctuary's fiscal sustainability. Lawrence and Pamela Tristle are two long-time supporters who generously donated half the cost to build Nikita's enclosure expansion as a matching grant, and hundreds of other supporters responded to help meet our goal. The first thing we had to do was make room for the addition, which meant lots of trimming, weeding, root removal, and leveling of the ground. Thanks to volunteers from the U.S. Army Citrus Park Recruiting Station here in Tampa, and of course, Big Cat Rescue volunteers, this was accomplished in record time, while Nikita kept busy watching over all involved. The perimeter of Nikita's new addition was marked out, and construction began. The walls of the enclosure were to be 15 feet in height, with a 5-foot cantilever, making the total height of the enclosure approximately 18 feet. Once all of the posts were in place, over 50 panels were hung, reinforced, cut to size, and then fixed in place. This process took almost three weeks to complete, and I'm sure Nikita was feeling a little sympathetic towards the workers. Then, the big day arrived. The Big Cat transformation was complete. Donors, volunteers, interns, and staff members alike all turned out to see Nikita take her first steps in her new territory. Everything was in place, including Nikita's favorite big yellow boomer ball, as well as a paper mache warthog for her to make friends with. Nikita was definitely ready to explore, while everybody eagerly looked on, and she didn't disappoint. Take a look. Big Cat Rescue would like to thank everyone who made this possible. Nikita may show her appreciation in unique ways, but thanks to our supporters, donors, and volunteers, we've truly enriched the life of this big girl.\nComment: Shere Khan is the largest cat here.

He's moved up the rankings now, he's probably the highest ranking male and he has a lovely personality. Normally a hyena wouldn't let you get this close while it's chomping on something, in this case a gopro, but he's a really fantastic chap. Monty, he's aged around, what are you, about 4 or 5 years old, so he's still a youngster and he's just incredible, he's almost like a human trapped in a plastic bag. This is Woody, and Woody is the second highest ranking male behind the gopro, which is the one chomping over there, and he won't give me the gopro back. Gina is the matriarch and is a gorgeous girl, she's allowed me around her cubs in the past, she's an extremely good mother, protective, and she's quite a loving matriarch in the way that she rules this clan. It's not like most hyenas with an eye on the first, she's actually quite well liked. Having said that, lately the oldest male in this clan has been taking quite a beating, his name's Shanzee, I'll try and go and see him just now, and the youngest hyena who won't come too close is Ringo, and that's because Ringo is wild raised by mum, and when I say wild raised he hasn't had any human influence.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over.

Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: it is like he is doing entertainment because im entertained by him just being a happy tiger so good job big cat rescue you guys are amazing people :3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Now the smallest gorilla in the group decides to show the mighty silverback Ranu who's in charge. This is hardly the great leader in control. Pushed around by the youngest male in the group and spurned by Tuck, the only female, things couldn't get much worse.\nComment: Silverbacks are gentle giants, not bullies.

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5. Mention any of the information that I wrote about above or anything I may have forgotten.Remember, please be polite but state your case.  This is the only chance we have and time is ticking away.

Walking around you can gaze upon some of the more amazing animals from around the world. From some of the largest to the downright deadly. Zoos offer the average Joe, and his family, a glimpse into the wonders of the natural world. The zoo can trace its origins back to a more family unfriendly time, to ancient Egypt, when for the pharaoh, owning a hippo zoo was completely normal. It was only into the 19th century when the roaring industrial masses wanted a piece of the action, and science was taking off that the modern zoo was born. And sure, zoos have received bad press in the past, but the modern zoo has been reinvented as a centre of science and conservation. So what are the roles of a modern zoo? Well, roughly speaking, we can divide them into three categories, education, breeding centres, and research. So let's start with education. It's simple really, zoos are a fun and safe place to learn for both kids and adults. The fact is, the animals are real, and you can get up and close to some of the more exotic and threatened creatures from around the world. Every year, 150 million people visit zoos around the world, and it's so important that the next generation is educated and understands the role they play in preserving our planet. Better still, many zoos have education centres with dedicated teams who aim to teach kids about everything from ecosystem services to climate change. Zoos also play an important role as breeding centres. Most zoos these days are part of organisations set up to coordinate breeding programmes and keep standards high. This means your favourite animal like the chimpanzee here is probably part of some national or even international breeding programme. These help zoos maintain genetic diversity and are extremely important for species that are threatened with extinction in the wild. One example is the scimitar-horned oryx. This is a species that became extinct in the wild and only survived in zoos and private collections. It is now part of several international breeding programmes and the hope is one day it will be reintroduced into the wild. And finally, Zoos offer a unique opportunity for biologists. Instead of spending days trying to track down an animal and becoming exhausted in the process, zoos offer a more controlled environment where effective research can be undertaken. Take the devastating disease chytridiomycosis. This has caused dramatic declines and even extinction in at least 200 species of frog. Zoos are actively taking part in research aiming to stop the spread of this disease. Research in zoos contribute to a number of scientific fields including animal behaviour and endocrinology, all ultimately contributing to the conservation of our biodiversity. So sure, a trip to the zoo is a great family day out, but zoos these days aren't there to show off your new hippo. Zoos are centres for conservation, educating the new generation, giving critically endangered species another chance and helping us gather knowledge for the conservation of species and biodiversity.

Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Tiger Shed Bobcat Box Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: So what's the story on this cat? Okay, this cat is at a place called a rescue farm, which apparently is a chain of rescues in Florida. I think there's three other ones, and they specialize in horses and small animals. And they have this tiger, the lady who, I don't know if she founded it or she was at least the permit holder there, is now hospitalized and doesn't have a good outlook. And one of the things that you can never plan for when you own a tiger is, you know, the inevitability of you're getting old. And the lady who owns Tigger is actually a patient in that hospital, right across the street. She's unable to take care of the cat. Hopefully that wasn't her. She's unable to take care of the cat, and it's left in the hands of people who don't know what they're doing, and more importantly, they don't have a license. Scary. They actually had a cougar, and they have a tiger, and a bobcat there. And the cougar has died, and the tiger is inside of a shed, and in a chain-link enclosure, and it has both sides of this, basically just a dog kennel. And they used to take her, when she was younger, they would take her to retirement homes to visit the elderly, and she walked on a leash everywhere. And of course, like everyone, everything else, when they get too big, that stops. The rescue farm has been sold to new owners, which are going to continue, but just in the capacity of smaller horses and smaller animals, like pocket pet type animals. The tiger's got to go. There'll be no permit holder on the property, and the bobcat's got to go. But as far as the tiger goes, none of who we label the bad guys want this tiger, because she has been spayed. And when I saw her last time, she is absolutely one of the most beautiful, big, just from appearance, Siberian tigers that I've ever seen. And she's been declawed and spayed, so she's of not much value for the breeder, so they don't want her. And basically, it puts Fish and Wildlife in a position where this tiger has nowhere to go, and they have no one that will take it, so the only thing they can do is euthanize it. And it's, you know, it's a lot of money. She's only six years old, so we're looking at probably 14-15 years of huge food bills, vet bills, and as always, you know, it's people that meant well in the beginning, but situations change, as they always do, and there's nowhere for it to go. It's been in this shed for at least three years since it's been outside and seen the sunlight, and when I saw it the first time, it was straining to climb the chain link to look outside and actually get a glimpse of the outside world. So it would be awesome to give this girl a good life. So this cat has never had, like, I mean, in the past three years, like, fresh air, or seen the outside, or anything? No, not at all. And before that, she only went outside on a leash, so it's not like she ever had an outdoor enclosure, or that she ever got to swim and run on grass and have any sort of life. So it's essentially, this has been it for her, but she's huge. She's about 600 pounds. She's a big tiger. And didn't you tell me that the other side of the kennel that she now has, the double side too, that the other side was where the cougar was living for initially, so she's only had half of that space? Absolutely, she's only had half of that space, and you know, there's just, just looking at it, you kind of cringe because there's tire swings hanging in there, stuff that she could get hurt on, and I don't know how. I mean, it's Florida. They hose that thing out. I don't know if she's ever dry, if that concrete is ever dry. And with her being declawed in the front, we know, we know what declawed cats end up looking like when they're on concrete. And this lady that's in the hospital, she's, you know, all she can think of, she's really not with it anymore, and she knows, she's just so emotionally attached to this tiger, and it's the same thing as we just saw in this chimp attack. She recently lost her husband and her own mother, and she's just projecting all of her hopes on this cat, and she's so devastated at the thought of giving it up that it's very, very hard for her. You know, it's just, it's such a reality check. She's never, ever gonna be able to take care of animals again, and you know, she's never gonna be able to afford animals again, and yet she's still worried. Her big concern is, is giving up her license to own these animals. She has concerns that that would somehow prevent her from ever working with animals again, and it's that, and that's, that's honestly her reality. She, you know, it sounds like if she's in liver failure, she may not even ever live outside of a hospital again, and yet, still in the back of her mind, that's bothering her, that she might have to give up that permit to own these kind of animals. And you see that all the time, where it's more about what the people feel like they're losing. It's not about what's best for the animal, it's about them, and it shouldn't be about them. Now, the cool part is the two ladies, the mother and daughter, that work there, that are taking care of this cat, they know that it's wrong, and they, they feel terrible. And again, I, you know, it's, I just think in their mind, they're doing everything they can, and they know it's not right. And when I talked to them, they, they almost seemed embarrassed, like they're ashamed of being part of this cat, but yet when they talk about her, they want to just, you know, they want to go in with her, they want to hug her, they just think of her. There's even a sign that says she's just a big house cat, and they just don't get it. They don't get it. And I mean, thankfully, this is honestly one of the most mild-mannered tigers I have ever seen, which is a good thing, because they'd probably both be dead by now. Do they go in with her? They, they say, they say that they don't, and they say that they don't take her out on the leash anymore, because they don't have, they're not legally licensed to own her. But, good Lord. That's the only reason? When I was there, they surely just opened that door, right, and tried to call her over there. Okay, I'm staying in the car for that one. And then when they saw how I reacted, oh, she won't come out, I said, yeah. Favorite last words. Yeah, exactly. And how does the owner justify this cat being in this shed? That's, that's not how she sees it. She sees that as, as part of what makes her complete, and that that's just a temporary situation. They always, you know, they always have grandiose plans that we're gonna have this huge outdoor enclosure with waterfalls, and caves, and huge swimming pools, and that's exactly what they told me. Well, the plan was to enclose a whole acre for her, and have a waterfall every time. You could probably, that, isn't that a broken record? Every time. Every one of these sanctuary sites that you go to has these incredible multi-million dollar plans of how they're gonna be taking care of these animals someday. If somebody would just send them the money, and when people do send them the money, it ends up going to salaries, it doesn't, they get more animals. But this is three years in the making still. Well, you know what, Barbara, when I asked them, because they said, well, she used to go outside all the time, and she used to do this, I said, well, honestly, when was the last time she's been outside? And they both kind of looked at each other, and they tried to figure it out in their heads, and then they were both, I mean, really hurt that it was three years. I don't think it even crossed their mind how long she had been in that shed. It's horrifying, and they, and I mean, the area is lined with cages with raccoons, and foxes, and chinchillas, and ferrets, and all these other animals in tiny, tiny cages, and then they have a piece of tape on the floor, because school kids come out there and take care of the little animals, and it's just, there's a piece of red tape that they know if you step over that line, you're too close to the tiger. Kids, school kids, elementary kids, and yet that's all that the state requires.\nComment: Sad sad.  I pray the authorities are doing all they can to stop this from ever happening again.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: A Growing Population of Mexican Wolves Endangered Mexican wolves are making a comeback in Arizona and New Mexico. Watch as wildlife managers count Mexican wolves to find out if 2014 is a record-breaking year. This video was created by the Information Branch of the Arizona Game and Fish Dept. Producer: David Majure.\nTranscript: December 2014 in the White Mountains of Arizona, a trail cam placed near the carcass of an elk records a pack of Mexican wolves showing up for breakfast. It's nothing unusual, yet it's absolutely extraordinary, especially when you consider that Mexican wolves nearly became extinct. By the early 1970s, there were zero wild Mexican wolves in the United States, and only a smattering could still be found in Mexico. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Mexican wolf as an endangered species in 1976. Today, Mexican wolves are making a comeback in Arizona and New Mexico, thanks to a captive breeding program and a reintroduction project that's been releasing and managing wolves since 1998. It's a partnership between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the Forest Service, the White Mountain Apache Tribe, and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. From the get-go, the goal was a self-sustaining population of at least 100 wolves by 2006. It's taken us almost 10 years after that to even come close to that number. Go find a location on RIM, go find Tsewa, only you're going to be over there on White Mountain. Jeff Dolphin is team leader for Arizona Game and Fish on the interagency field team, which does the day-to-day management of this experimental population of Mexican wolves. Does anybody not know what they're doing tomorrow? At the end of each year, the team does a population survey to find out how many wolves are living in the wild. We've got 10 animals, we're just trying to find 1331. The front seat can just turn the antenna and find the wolf just by turning it that way. They use radio telemetry to search for wolves wearing radio collars. When they find a wolf without a collar, or one that needs a new one, they may try to capture it. Chasing wolves through tall trees in a helicopter is difficult. It's probably some of the most demanding flying I do, just between the terrain, the trees, and trying to follow a running wolf through the trees without running into anything. It's very demanding. And sticking it with a tranquilizer dart is never easy. I'm looking out of the helicopter or muggers on the side trying to locate the wolves with the radio telemetry. What you're witnessing is wildlife management in action. It's unbelievably challenging. You just got to be patient and persistent. And it's infinitely rewarding. All of these wolves right now are wild born, wild raised, and they're surviving on their own. They're not needing help to survive from us. They're doing what we want them to do, but we're really seeing a dramatic incline in the population right now. When a wolf is delivered, the processing team goes to work immediately. Who's doing the microchips? This animal came in pretty hot from the chase and everything else, and through the IV fluids and cold packs, we've actually got her temperature back down to normal. The team documents the wolf's physical characteristics. It provides immunizations, monitors vital signs, and does any doctoring that's needed. So this is pretty much a resolving bite wound. The priority is to get the animal collared and back into the wild as soon and as safely as possible. For three straight years, the Mexican wolf population has increased by at least 10%. But this year's count was better than ever. The 2014 Mexican wolf population survey documented a minimum of 109 wolves in the wild, a 31% increase that finally broke the century mark. We're busting at the seams with wolves right now for this recovery area. With 19 packs and 38 pups, the future is bright for Mexican wolves. And it's only getting brighter. In 2015, big changes to the rules governing the recovery efforts gave Mexican wolves more room to roam. The area they're allowed to occupy in Arizona and New Mexico grew from 7,000 to more than 150,000 square miles. And the goal for the number of wolves more than tripled, from 100 to as many as 325. It's a number the project partners believe will give the wolves the greatest chance of success. A number that strikes a balance between the wolf population, available prey resources, and public acceptance. A number that ensures the Mexican wolf's comeback continues.\nComment: It is amazing they repopulate the Mexican wolves in breeding program, the wolves deserved to life free and never hunt them again"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: I can't count the amount of times I learned about white bengal tigers in school, and not once did they ever teach us about this, which is what I should have been learning about."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

You can tell the difference between the black and White Rhino due to the shape of their lip. He love's rolling in his mud bath and having a scratch, this beauty regimen also helps protect him from the sun and mosquitoes. Rhinos have poor eyesight but good smell and hearing and they need to be on the lookout as they are endangered due to the demand for their horn in traditional medicine. Cast Robert and Bindi Irwin.      Crew; Producer: Tom Armstrong, Camera Operator: Ryan Mooney, Sound Recordist: Scott Mulready. Editor: Lucy Garrick, Graphics: Matt White.\nTranscript: This is our gorgeous white rhino, Kai. Although he may look really big and tough, he's actually as sweet as a puppy dog. Well what Kai does is he's actually got a big mud bath in his enclosure. It's pretty cool. He gets a bit dirty. Sometimes when he has that mud all over him, he loves it if you can just pick it off and scratch. It just kind of feels like a massage. They have that mud on their back to help them as like a sunscreen and a mosquito repellent. They actually can't see really well. But Robert, what can they do? They have really, really good hearing. And what's funny about Kai is if you look just on his ears, he's got those little tufts of fur. Isn't that silly? We're not really sure why he has it. Maybe it's to keep the dust out of his ears. This is the white rhino. And they're different from their cousin, the black rhino, for a few different reasons. Firstly, these guys are grazers. So if you look at their mouth, they have that real rectangular shape and really big squishy lips. That's because they eat things like grass. But if you compare them to their cousin, the black rhino, they have a more triangular shaped mouth, don't they? Yeah. It's really pointy. And do you know why they have that? That's because they eat different foods. It's true. So they eat more like things like shrubs. Yeah, so rhinos can actually grow up to be two tons. They're really, really heavy. It's true. Now, the poor rhinos are in a lot of trouble. They're actually critically endangered because of that gorgeous horn. That horn is made out of keratin, which is the same as our fingernails. What people do is they'll kill the rhinos for that horn to turn it into traditional medicine. The biggest thing to protect rhinos or any wildlife is to never, ever buy wildlife products. Kai is one of our biggest animals here at Australia Zoo. But we have lots more, both big and small. So make sure you tune in next time. Yeah, and remember to subscribe to the Pet Collective channel. See ya. Bye. ♪♪♪\nComment: And ofcos, the ultimate way to save animals from traditional medicine/ fur coats etc is to never ever buy the product. Less demand for them and it will gradually lessen.

Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five. I'm Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism.\nComment: Nice video."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

You can nearly touch them.\nTranscript: So we're going to be taking Georgie and Yami a walk. Let's go. Yeah. Time for a drive. And it's an enrichment walk. We do this with all the lions. It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back.

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: And this is the work of the master builder among bower birds. I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: Just brilliant!!

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: I just hope they treat them well"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: Sad that we must change everything around us and we just can't love them the way they are."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This footage was shot at beautiful Animal Kingdom (Disney) in Orlando, Fl.\nTranscript: The large flying fox is one of the biggest bats in the world. Even though it may weigh, on average, only two pounds, its wingspan can get to around six feet wide. That is one of the reasons this bat belongs to the suborder, megabat. Or as I say, the suborder, MEGABAT! These large bats are just one of many species of flying fox. They get their name due to their heads, which up close, sort of look like a fox with their pointed ears. These large flying fox come from the islands of Southeast Asia. They will roost high up in the trees and they will become active at sunrise and at sunset. So they aren't strictly nocturnal. And since they're considered an old world bat, they also can't echolocate like some other bats can. So they rely on their sense of smell and strong eyesight to locate food. Food for these large bats is pollen, leaves, flowers, and fruits. So you don't have to worry, they're not going to suck your blood. They play an important role where they can take fruit seeds from one island to another to help the fruits grow in new locations. Now unfortunately, they are often seen as pests since they eat flowers and they then are over hunted. These large flying foxes also need a lot of trees and in Southeast Asia, a lot of forests and jungles are being cut down due to the growing human population and a need for more space. The flying fox will usually give birth to just one pup so it's very important to conserve each and every large bat we see. Their young will stay with them for around 12 to 14 weeks and then they become mature enough to go out on their own. For more information on the flying fox, please read this video's description below.

Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old.

Today Simon, the Founder of Wildlife Aid Foundation, was called out to rescue an adult Fox that was tangled up in a shed somewhere in Epsom.To his amazement, the lady opened the door to a very embarrassed looking fox who had come a cropper on a lawn mower's power cable!Simon struggled to understand just how the poor Fox could get so entangled in such a small piece of exposed cable. He did his best to restore the Fox's dignity and freedom, however the constriction on his leg was too bad and required treatment back at the wildlife hospital.As it's St George's Day we have decided to called the Fox St George (only for online referencing), however we can't see him slaying any Dragon's anytime soon!You can follow St George's progress on our Facebook page: www.facebook.com/wildlifeaidAbout TheWildlifeAidTVEver wanted to see the goings on behind the scenes at a Wildlife Rescue Centre? Well now you can! We have super cute hedgehogs eating their dinner, dramatic rescues of wild deer and everything in between.\nTranscript: Well, we've got a fox trapped in a shed and apparently he's trapped in some wire in the shed, so I'm not quite sure what kit we're going to need. Hello, do you have a fox trapped in a shed? Yes, it's a one hind leg, very tight. Is it? Yeah, he got so frightened up there. Well, I can see the injuries. He looks very tightly constricted by one of his legs. It looks incredibly tight. I don't really, he's mangy as well, which is a slight worry. What I want to try and do is grasp him so when I finish he can't leg it at great speed. All right, foxy dogs. How he's got stuck around that is absurd. I'm trying to get the fox out without damaging the lady's lawnmower, which is going to be quite interesting. I'm afraid he's already bitten through the mains cable by himself. There's nothing I can do about that. That was not me, I'm innocent. If I can get this handle off the lawnmower, that might give me a bit of slack to play with. Okay, now, I'm getting somewhere. That's it, now the pressure's off. All right, fella. You could have done this if you tried. Okay, he doesn't know it yet, but he's out. So before he knows he's out, I just need to get him grasped so he can't escape, which I've now done. Now I can move that out of the way. I can put the lady's lawnmower back together in a minute, but it has made the leg swollen, and because he's got mange anyway, he'll have to come back into the centre, and we'll see how much damage it's done to the leg. If it's been shut for too long, then obviously there's going to be a constriction problem. You tell them what one pot's contained without me being bitten. That's a bonus. Do they know how long he was stuck? Probably not more than overnight. I'm hoping there's not going to be a serious constriction. Toes are nice and warm. Yeah. Still very swollen. So what I'm probably going to do is shave that bit, so that we can really keep an eye on it. I'm not going to clip it right to the skin, just so that we can see what we're looking at, because sometimes these injuries take a few days to really show themselves. Having clipped it, you can really see how red it is. If this tissue dies here, then there's nothing you can do to stop it. So what we don't want to see is that going sort of black and hard tomorrow. I'm just going to put some of this lovely gel on it today. Just to keep it moist while the skin is hopefully healing. You can see the mange all around this area. It's really common to see it on the rumps of foxes. They quite often get sore patches over the bony hips as well. His heart's really slow. Wheezy as well. Well, he's having antibiotics anyway, for any secondary skin infections that they have from the mange, which is also going to help with his chesty breathing there. And then this is the treatment for the mange. They have to have this every week for three weeks. And then the final treatment will be a spot-on treatment before he goes free. Hopefully, if that leg's OK, we might only have to keep him a couple of weeks. Well, we've done all we can for now. He'll be with us two weeks. He'll be very lucky, probably three weeks, but he should go out in a lot better state than he is now. It's just a matter for the next 72 hours of keeping an eye on that wound, because that is absolutely critical. It's a tinny little house. How do you like it? The one in the corner's just non-stop stuffed his face since he got here. Like, oh, yeah, Liz's face is wicked. Ow!

Sure, it was the number one dishwashing brand, the biggest advertiser in the category, and sported some of the highest equity ratings of all consumer goods in the country. So what's the problem, you ask? What we haven't mentioned yet is that we're the most expensive brand. Consumers spend an average of 18 seconds at shelf and tend to make rational decisions based on price. So Dawn had to turn to something it has, something our competition will never have, a commitment to saving wildlife cotton oil spills. The best part about it is the fact that it isn't some invented marketing ploy. It's the one and only cleaner wildlife experts have been using to clean animals' cotton oil spills for more than 30 years. Why? Because Dawn is tough enough to cut through grease, even natural disaster-type grease, while being gentle enough to clean the delicate skins of these animals, as you can see in our national TV commercial. Wildlife rescue workers open up a lot of Dawn, tough on grease, yet gentle. Dawn helps open something even bigger. This year, Dawn is also donating $1 million. Learn more at Dawn Saves Wildlife. The centerpiece of our effort was a nine-part documentary series, The Big Picture, shown only online. The series showed the everyday threats to wildlife and explained what people could do about it. The Big Picture could be seen on dawnsaveswildlife.com and YouTube. Pelicans are one of California's big success stories. They just came off the endangered species list in 2009. They're thriving despite all of these issues that they're still having to deal with. Pelicans are prehistoric creatures. This is an animal that's evolved over time and is specific for plunge-feeding fish. When people feed them, they stop doing what they do naturally and start looking in the dumpsters. What happens with that is they become dirty. The biggest problem that it causes is it contaminates their feathers. And that ability to be waterproof, it can make them hypothetical. At the end of the day, they have to be cleaned. We have the product that does it, and it works better than anything. Dawn. Paid media drove people to the micro-site. The micro-site encouraged consumers to share with their friends on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. We use social media to update our fans on the program, sharing each new episode, and sharing the results of the micro-site. The micro-site is a place where you can share with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. It's a new episode and enabling consumers to show their support for the cause. When our consumer got to the store, she was drawn to images of wildlife on shelf displays, end aisle caps, and, of course, on the limited-edition bottle labels themselves. The campaign was picked up by news channels like CNN, Good Morning America, Huffington Post, and People magazine. Rob Lowe made special appearances talking about his support of the program and his role as narrator. There are countless little ways to help save wildlife that make a big difference, from volunteering at your local wildlife shelter to attending events like National Wildlife Day. You can share this video series with family and friends, even things you can do at home, like shopping with reusable cloth bags and washing your dishes with Dawn.

Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: Thanks, BCR, for sharing this important information about white tiger inbreeding.  I think I first learned about it through your posts several years ago, and have been trying to spread the word every since.  Unfortunately places like Six Flags Discovery Kingdom still have white tigers (along with other animals) and in their show, say nothing about the inbreeding problem.  I hope more people seeing this video will share it and get things changed."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over.

The cats' efforts were captured by high-definition and slow-motion cameras for the Saving a Species series for teachers.Subscribe to our channel on YouTube:  to our print magazine:  our Blog:  us on Twitter:  a fan on Facebook:  our TV show: \nTranscript: Today we're shooting an episode of Shamu TV. It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection. It's just something that we've been doing for a long time. We're very passionate about our care for animals and we want to share that with everyone.\nComment: Omg, they're so darn cute!

Today Simon, the Founder of Wildlife Aid Foundation, was called out to rescue an adult Fox that was tangled up in a shed somewhere in Epsom.To his amazement, the lady opened the door to a very embarrassed looking fox who had come a cropper on a lawn mower's power cable!Simon struggled to understand just how the poor Fox could get so entangled in such a small piece of exposed cable. He did his best to restore the Fox's dignity and freedom, however the constriction on his leg was too bad and required treatment back at the wildlife hospital.As it's St George's Day we have decided to called the Fox St George (only for online referencing), however we can't see him slaying any Dragon's anytime soon!You can follow St George's progress on our Facebook page: www.facebook.com/wildlifeaidAbout TheWildlifeAidTVEver wanted to see the goings on behind the scenes at a Wildlife Rescue Centre? Well now you can! We have super cute hedgehogs eating their dinner, dramatic rescues of wild deer and everything in between.\nTranscript: Well, we've got a fox trapped in a shed and apparently he's trapped in some wire in the shed, so I'm not quite sure what kit we're going to need. Hello, do you have a fox trapped in a shed? Yes, it's a one hind leg, very tight. Is it? Yeah, he got so frightened up there. Well, I can see the injuries. He looks very tightly constricted by one of his legs. It looks incredibly tight. I don't really, he's mangy as well, which is a slight worry. What I want to try and do is grasp him so when I finish he can't leg it at great speed. All right, foxy dogs. How he's got stuck around that is absurd. I'm trying to get the fox out without damaging the lady's lawnmower, which is going to be quite interesting. I'm afraid he's already bitten through the mains cable by himself. There's nothing I can do about that. That was not me, I'm innocent. If I can get this handle off the lawnmower, that might give me a bit of slack to play with. Okay, now, I'm getting somewhere. That's it, now the pressure's off. All right, fella. You could have done this if you tried. Okay, he doesn't know it yet, but he's out. So before he knows he's out, I just need to get him grasped so he can't escape, which I've now done. Now I can move that out of the way. I can put the lady's lawnmower back together in a minute, but it has made the leg swollen, and because he's got mange anyway, he'll have to come back into the centre, and we'll see how much damage it's done to the leg. If it's been shut for too long, then obviously there's going to be a constriction problem. You tell them what one pot's contained without me being bitten. That's a bonus. Do they know how long he was stuck? Probably not more than overnight. I'm hoping there's not going to be a serious constriction. Toes are nice and warm. Yeah. Still very swollen. So what I'm probably going to do is shave that bit, so that we can really keep an eye on it. I'm not going to clip it right to the skin, just so that we can see what we're looking at, because sometimes these injuries take a few days to really show themselves. Having clipped it, you can really see how red it is. If this tissue dies here, then there's nothing you can do to stop it. So what we don't want to see is that going sort of black and hard tomorrow. I'm just going to put some of this lovely gel on it today. Just to keep it moist while the skin is hopefully healing. You can see the mange all around this area. It's really common to see it on the rumps of foxes. They quite often get sore patches over the bony hips as well. His heart's really slow. Wheezy as well. Well, he's having antibiotics anyway, for any secondary skin infections that they have from the mange, which is also going to help with his chesty breathing there. And then this is the treatment for the mange. They have to have this every week for three weeks. And then the final treatment will be a spot-on treatment before he goes free. Hopefully, if that leg's OK, we might only have to keep him a couple of weeks. Well, we've done all we can for now. He'll be with us two weeks. He'll be very lucky, probably three weeks, but he should go out in a lot better state than he is now. It's just a matter for the next 72 hours of keeping an eye on that wound, because that is absolutely critical. It's a tinny little house. How do you like it? The one in the corner's just non-stop stuffed his face since he got here. Like, oh, yeah, Liz's face is wicked. Ow!

Well what Kai does is he's actually got a big mud bath in his enclosure. It's pretty cool. He gets a bit dirty. Sometimes when he has that mud all over him, he loves it if you can just pick it off and scratch. It just kind of feels like a massage. They have that mud on their back to help them as like a sunscreen and a mosquito repellent. They actually can't see really well. But Robert, what can they do? They have really, really good hearing. And what's funny about Kai is if you look just on his ears, he's got those little tufts of fur. Isn't that silly? We're not really sure why he has it. Maybe it's to keep the dust out of his ears. This is the white rhino. And they're different from their cousin, the black rhino, for a few different reasons. Firstly, these guys are grazers. So if you look at their mouth, they have that real rectangular shape and really big squishy lips. That's because they eat things like grass. But if you compare them to their cousin, the black rhino, they have a more triangular shaped mouth, don't they? Yeah. It's really pointy. And do you know why they have that? That's because they eat different foods. It's true. So they eat more like things like shrubs. Yeah, so rhinos can actually grow up to be two tons. They're really, really heavy. It's true. Now, the poor rhinos are in a lot of trouble. They're actually critically endangered because of that gorgeous horn. That horn is made out of keratin, which is the same as our fingernails.

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Winter Squirrel Hunting Winter squirrel hunting is a challenging and underutilized sport in Kansas. Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: I worked as a development engineer in Cambodia for 20 years developing special equipment for clearing and/or destroying landmines and unexploded ordnance. Talking to the many experts the general opinion was that rats were not much use as there attention span was very short due to the harsh working environment. There were similar problems with sniffer dogs."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels.

Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: R.I.P Big guy!!! He was my favorite when I visited. "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old.

Walking around you can gaze upon some of the more amazing animals from around the world. From some of the largest to the downright deadly. Zoos offer the average Joe, and his family, a glimpse into the wonders of the natural world. The zoo can trace its origins back to a more family unfriendly time, to ancient Egypt, when for the pharaoh, owning a hippo zoo was completely normal. It was only into the 19th century when the roaring industrial masses wanted a piece of the action, and science was taking off that the modern zoo was born. And sure, zoos have received bad press in the past, but the modern zoo has been reinvented as a centre of science and conservation. So what are the roles of a modern zoo? Well, roughly speaking, we can divide them into three categories, education, breeding centres, and research. So let's start with education. It's simple really, zoos are a fun and safe place to learn for both kids and adults. The fact is, the animals are real, and you can get up and close to some of the more exotic and threatened creatures from around the world. Every year, 150 million people visit zoos around the world, and it's so important that the next generation is educated and understands the role they play in preserving our planet. Better still, many zoos have education centres with dedicated teams who aim to teach kids about everything from ecosystem services to climate change. Zoos also play an important role as breeding centres. Most zoos these days are part of organisations set up to coordinate breeding programmes and keep standards high. This means your favourite animal like the chimpanzee here is probably part of some national or even international breeding programme. These help zoos maintain genetic diversity and are extremely important for species that are threatened with extinction in the wild. One example is the scimitar-horned oryx. This is a species that became extinct in the wild and only survived in zoos and private collections. It is now part of several international breeding programmes and the hope is one day it will be reintroduced into the wild. And finally, Zoos offer a unique opportunity for biologists. Instead of spending days trying to track down an animal and becoming exhausted in the process, zoos offer a more controlled environment where effective research can be undertaken. Take the devastating disease chytridiomycosis. This has caused dramatic declines and even extinction in at least 200 species of frog. Zoos are actively taking part in research aiming to stop the spread of this disease. Research in zoos contribute to a number of scientific fields including animal behaviour and endocrinology, all ultimately contributing to the conservation of our biodiversity. So sure, a trip to the zoo is a great family day out, but zoos these days aren't there to show off your new hippo. Zoos are centres for conservation, educating the new generation, giving critically endangered species another chance and helping us gather knowledge for the conservation of species and biodiversity.

Thanks for watching!\nComment: Because if not we would have trophy hunters “sustainably use” every single endangered or critically-endangered animal on this planet, and more often than not the most endangered of all groups of animals, that we paradoxically don’t really care or think about, either, are the ones they don’t want as trophies. For example in South Africa where *legal, regulated* hunting has actually saved some of the species being targeted like lions and white rhinos (which, I’ll admit I hate with a passion, too, and I’ve often gotten into heated arguments with trophy hunting proponents on the Internet despite the fact that it helps support poor local people there, as well. None of us are perfect), however, penguins living in the southernmost parts of the country, as well as in Namibia, are still very much endangered and in decline, and guess what? Sport hunters don’t want them in their collections, even though, once again, *legal and well-regulated* hunting has saved the “Big Five” in South Africa, thus it’s sort of a slap-in-the-face to us at least interested in working in properly-accredited zoos and aquariums where we work with captive-bred birds in order to at least have a viable breeding population. \n\nTurtles and tortoises also aren’t usually targeted by the industry, either, and yet, statistically-speaking, *they’re the most endangered group of vertebrates on this planet, right next to primates* (which I’ll also get to in a minute), so many, many properly-accredited zoos and aquariums, along with the Turtle Survival Alliance and other conservancies, collaborate to breed more endangered turtle and tortoise species so that they can, eventually, be re-released into the wild, and the great apes, for example gorillas and orangutans, that sport hunters also don’t target simply because they share over 90% of our DNA with us, are also considered critically-endangered in the wild due to habitat loss and the unsustainable bushmeat trade. The Indianapolis Zoo’s International Orangutan Center, for example, helps fund research in the Leuser Ecosystem National Strategic Area in Sumatra: \n\nhttps://www.indianapoliszoo.com/exhibits/orangutan-center/orangutans/\n\nSimply put they help species in decline trophy hunters don’t want."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: @MsPatyma Thanks, we're doing our best and will keep doing it :) Happy New Year!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They need a roomy nesting hole, usually made when a large branch falls off a mature tree, which doesn't happen very often. Scientists have installed surveillance cameras into nest holes like this, to get an intimate, kind of big-brother view into the private lives of hornbills. These unique pictures show a female hornbill making herself at home. She needs to feel as comfortable as possible, because she's going to be a prisoner in here for up to four months. Once in, she starts preparing to seal up the door. She's plugging the entrance with mud, pieces of wood and sticky fruit, and leaving just a very narrow slit. And the reason why she shuts herself away is to lay her egg and protect her chick. From now on, she'll depend entirely on her partner to survive. He makes about ten or more runs a day, bringing back about a kilogram of food, a varied diet of fruit, insects, small reptiles and young birds. He stores it in his throat, and once back at the nest, regurgitates it for his family. With such intensive care, the chick grows fast, and eats mum out of house and home. After five weeks, there's only room inside the hole for him. Once a pair have found their ideal home, they'll keep on coming back for years. So trees like this are critical to the survival of these endangered birds. If this nest isn't available next year, this chick's parents may never find another.\nComment: Dear Sister & BBC Discovery Groups and also Youtube:\n\n                             This is Very very Good for me and for all Zomi People Group.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: Nice, all the very best wishes to the rats and it's trainer."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

These baby woodpeckers fell to the ground when the rotten tree that their nest was in was pushed over. In this miraculous story of compassion, Captain Quinn saves the baby birds.\nTranscript: Captain Quinn here. Saving baby birds. Yeah, that's right. Woodpecker, to be exact. Baby woodpeckers. Flickers, to be even more specific. So about a week ago, I was building this chicken coop here, which happens to be crookeder than a witch's nose, but we won't get hung up on that. The chickens don't care. And I noticed this rotten old birch tree, and it was a complete safety hazard. So I pushed it over with my muscles, and when it hit the ground, it exploded right in the center. And I heard, squawk, squawk, squawk! And I looked, and there were seven baby woodpeckers. So I felt terrible, decided I had to do something. You know, like, they have just as much a right to be here as I do. So I gathered them all up in my warm embrace, put them in a shoebox, kept them warm in a dark place, and then did a little research, called an animal rescue helpline, and found out that I can either feed them a diluted mixture of cat food and plain yogurt every half an hour. Well, that's not going to happen. Or I can drive them the two and a half hours to the closest animal rescue shelter. That's also not going to happen. Or, their best chance at survival is to actually put them back in their nest, and put that nest back to where it originally was, so the parents can find them. You see, birds have a very poor sense of smell, but they have a very, very strong bond between the parents and the offspring, just like every other animal, which is pretty powerful, a bond that can't be broken easily. So I decided to reconstruct their nest, put them back in, hoist them back up to roughly the same spot, and see if the parents would come back. The problem was, the nest was in shatters, about 50 different pieces. But, I'm a crafty man, so I grabbed all the pieces, a few screws, hammered the screws into the old rotten tree, and duct taped around it with this clear duct tape, packing tape I think, and put the little critters back in, and tied a rope around the top of the rotten snag, and hoisted her back up, and waited. 15 minutes later, to my delight, one of the parents came back, and went right back in the little hole, and fed their little, you know, their offspring, the little babies. I've been observing these birds for about a week now, and it's pretty magnificent. About every 10 to 20 minutes, one of the parents, the mom or the dad, come back with food. They feed the little youngsters, and then they clean up the nest. They fly out, they're busy, they're at it all day. And it's been very cool getting to watch that. Pretty exciting. And they don't mind having chickens as neighbors, and they don't mind me as a spectator. So, it's been pretty cool. And it's been about a week. They've feathered up, and I check on them every day. They come over here to their home, and I, you know, I just tell them, you know, how are you guys doing? And as you can hear, they're quite little chatterboxes. There's a little hole in here I left so I could peek on them, see how they're doing. They're getting feathers. How are you guys doing? When are you planning on leaving the nest? Huh? Huh? About that time, I think. Oh, hi! I'm now, for scientific purposes, so we can get a better understanding of what exactly goes down in a woodpecker's nest, going to stick the pecker cam down inside Woody Woodpecker's hole. No, this is not a colonoscopy. See, woodpeckers, unlike other birds, have their nests inside hollow, rotten trees. I think, I'm not exactly sure what their plan is here. I don't know if they're going to peck their way out of there or climb up and jump. I'm not sure, but I'll keep you posted on that. But I just thought that, you know, if I can save a baby bird, then so can you. And sometimes, as we are being human and doing human things, we put the lives of animals at risk, and I think that we need to remember that they have a right to be here, just as much, if not more so, than us. So if we do find ourselves in a position where we have jeopardized the life of another living animal, I think we should do everything we can to save it and protect it. I'm Captain Quinn, and that's how to save a baby bird. See you next time.

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back.

Well what Kai does is he's actually got a big mud bath in his enclosure. It's pretty cool. He gets a bit dirty. Sometimes when he has that mud all over him, he loves it if you can just pick it off and scratch. It just kind of feels like a massage. They have that mud on their back to help them as like a sunscreen and a mosquito repellent. They actually can't see really well. But Robert, what can they do? They have really, really good hearing. And what's funny about Kai is if you look just on his ears, he's got those little tufts of fur. Isn't that silly? We're not really sure why he has it. Maybe it's to keep the dust out of his ears. This is the white rhino. And they're different from their cousin, the black rhino, for a few different reasons. Firstly, these guys are grazers. So if you look at their mouth, they have that real rectangular shape and really big squishy lips. That's because they eat things like grass. But if you compare them to their cousin, the black rhino, they have a more triangular shaped mouth, don't they? Yeah. It's really pointy. And do you know why they have that? That's because they eat different foods. It's true. So they eat more like things like shrubs. Yeah, so rhinos can actually grow up to be two tons. They're really, really heavy. It's true. Now, the poor rhinos are in a lot of trouble. They're actually critically endangered because of that gorgeous horn. That horn is made out of keratin, which is the same as our fingernails. What people do is they'll kill the rhinos for that horn to turn it into traditional medicine. The biggest thing to protect rhinos or any wildlife is to never, ever buy wildlife products. Kai is one of our biggest animals here at Australia Zoo. But we have lots more, both big and small. So make sure you tune in next time. Yeah, and remember to subscribe to the Pet Collective channel.

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5.

First released by Captain Cook for a food source for the pioneers of this country, the Feral Pig has thrived in our conditions and multiplied to almost plague proportions. Up here in the territory, the good living has seen the Feral Pig population explode. Cape York is probably the first destination most people think of when they think of pig hunting, but up here in the territory, their numbers are just as strong. I've heard of boars up to around 240 kilos being caught in the territory, but between 80 and 100 kilos is a good sized boar. They are an environmental terrorist, destroying vast tracts of land. In the south, they destroy crops and livestock, decimating the income of our already struggling farmers. Up here in the north, they tear our wetlands and national parks to shreds. No wetland has been left untouched. They act as carriers of weeds and exotic diseases, and they tear up the land until it becomes a mess of impassable pig ruts. Anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of driving across them will know what I mean. With a keen sense of smell, excellent hearing, and razor sharp tusks, pigs can be considered as dangerous game. Wounded animals are especially dangerous, and I've had a few close calls with wounded boars. There seems to be a lot of difference in opinion on what is the best calibre of hunting pigs. My opinion is, if it kills them, use it. I've shot them with everything from a .22 to a .375 Ultramag, but the latter can get quite expensive when you look at how many pigs we have up here. The smaller calibres can have problems penetrating the thick fighting pads and mud on the larger boars, so aiming at the base of the ear is your best bet when shooting with a small calibre. When using the bigger calibres, aiming tight behind the shoulder has always yielded good results for me. Herds of 30 or more are not uncommon. A group of animals this large will destroy a patch of dirt bigger than a football field every single food sitting. The feral pig is a real menace, and we as hunters need to do our part.\nComment: This is where epic meal time needs to go for their bacon"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over.

The cats' efforts were captured by high-definition and slow-motion cameras for the Saving a Species series for teachers.Subscribe to our channel on YouTube:  to our print magazine:  our Blog:  us on Twitter:  a fan on Facebook:  our TV show: \nTranscript: Today we're shooting an episode of Shamu TV. It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection. It's just something that we've been doing for a long time. We're very passionate about our care for animals and we want to share that with everyone.\nComment: Such an amazingly beautiful animal."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: Bing this to the house of command in Nagaland make change people"},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old.

Satisfying his curiosity, getting human scent, he suddenly turns and runs and just heads away from that human scent. Runs through the grass away, tail up.

This is Wendy the Guide Girl, also known as Hawk Hunter Diva if you're watching YouTube. I'm sitting in my own back pasture instead of down at the leaves, shopping for some venison. I haven't seen anything I wanted to fling an arrow at yet. I'm in the antler hunting mode. So I got some new stuff from Buzzy. It's called Bowhunter Setup Scrape Juice. So I'm going to test that out today and see if I can't bring in something new. I see something just jumped the fence and I haven't seen it before. So let's check it out and see if he's a shooter. Well, good evening. Welcome to Butch and Wendy's Hunting Adventures. Hawk Hunter Diva decided to go try to get some venison. So we're here in the Hill Country, Texas. The deer are a little smaller up here compared to South Texas or up north, but we have a whole lot of them. I've been sitting in a pop-up blind watching a stream of does and little bucks and stuff. And I was actually after this eight point buck. He was nice and mature, but he didn't come in this morning. And while I was sitting there, this little ten point came in. Well, for the Hill Country, he's a nice little deer. And I decided to go ahead and take him. I had a good hunt. It was nice. And another deal was, the wind wasn't quite blowing right. It's kind of switching around because we have a front coming in. Right now it's 76 degrees here in Central Texas, but tomorrow it's going to be 35 degrees. So actually I was even hunting in shorts this evening. But anyway, the wind was swirling. The deer kept coming in. They were a little spooky. So I'll tell you what I did. I got this Muzzy's Bowhunter set up, the scrape juice, and I sprayed a little bit out the window. And he came in shortly afterwards, but I'll tell you what, don't spray it inside the blind. It smells pretty rough, but I bet deer really like it because I had never seen this buck before out of all the deer I've been watching for the past couple of weeks. And it brought him in, so I guess it works. But have a good evening. Muzzy Phantom did the job, shot him with a crossbow. Central Hill Country of Texas, and it's October 27th, 2010. Y'all have a good evening. We're going to try to go get some more venison here this season, but I guess I'm going to have to change clothes and get something warm. See y'all next time. Later.\nComment: @yournamehere832 Oh yes it did and still is! The deer were so scraggly, I couldn't see butchering any of the does coming in but they are doing better now that everyone is feeding corn around here.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: All animals are amazing! Even flys are a part of the ecosystem they are here for a reason. Hunting something so important will not be good for the earth and just really, how, just why would you? I guess if it will kill you and it's ether you or a loin or any other animal. "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

A new foal is trying to stand for the first time. Try as it will, the little foal's back legs just don't seem to work. The mare guards it from her curious two-year-old son. As the hours pass, I realize something's wrong. Even the band's stallion, Boomer, tries to encourage the foal. That's when another band moves into the meadow, led by the husky stallion, Looking Glass. Boomer's little band moves away. And the foal tries, but cannot follow. Looking Glass's lead mare notices something in the grass. She's joined by a second mare and a young stallion. She seems to encourage the foal, while Boomer's band looks on. Then Looking Glass approaches. And I was shocked at what happened next. The mares try to stop him. Boomer charges in, but it's too late. I tell myself the stallion did the foal a favor, saving it from a lingering death. But Looking Glass's aggression is disturbing and haunting.\nComment: Clearly Looking Glass was acting in the best interest of both herds here. \nThat foal was unable to survive despite the assistance from both herds. Typically it falls on the herd's stallion to...dispose... of a doomed foal, but with Looking Glass' band having moved in and forced Boomer's band away, Looking Glass became the only stallion available to do what had to be done. After checking the foal himself, he took the only action which was left to either stallion.  \nIt *was* a mercy killing, if something so brutal can be called that. But it was more a mercy for both bands than for the foal. \n\nI see this from time to time with brumby mobs, though typically brumby herds sharing space will work together to help a foal. If it can't be saved, then the stallion who sired it will be the one to terminate it with the other stallion often standing off a small distance while this happens."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Up backpacking with the kids and brother-in-laws Uncle Bingo and I had a close encounter with a Bull Moose. Returning to the car to gather extra gear for the kids at dusk, turned a bend on the trail and a bull moose was not too far off. I was in his comfort zone and he let me know it. Some very raw footage and just a snapshot of the trip. Also, Bingo and I having some fun talking about the youtube series \"Guy on a Buffalo.\" Personally I find it funny.Please visit \nTranscript: Let me set up this video for you. So I went backpacking, well, if you want to call it backpacking, with my kids, my brother-in-laws and their kids. Because we had so many young kids with us, we actually didn't go in very far at all. But we went in, found a spot, dropped all our stuff, and some of the adults stayed with the kids, and me and Uncle Bingo, actually, you've seen him in my films before, we went back down to the car to get the rest of the sleeping bags and that kind of stuff. But what happened is, I actually went down first. I kind of bushwhacked a little bit, you guys know how I like that, and then I hooked up with a trail later, and I was just, oh, I don't know, probably 50 yards ahead of him. And as I'm walking down, I'm almost to the street, and I notice a car was parked on the street right where our cars were parked, and it was just sitting there. I'm thinking, what is that car doing? As I walk and I come around this tree, I look over and there's a nice big old bull moose. And he's, well, he's not huge, but he's sitting there and he sees me come around the corner, he stops and he looks at me. And then my brother-in-law, Uncle Bingo, starts coming behind me, and I tell him to kind of be quiet because I want to get some film of this guy, and I kind of wave him over. But one thing I always talk about is looking for body language, and you're going to see it in this one. One of the signs of aggression that moose exhibit when you are in their space is they will often lower their heads, their ears will lay back on their heads. And then this guy, he started a beeline right at me. Now, what to look for here is, the first thing I did when I saw him, I thought, yeah, we're kind of close, but I'll be honest, you get a camera in my hand and all I'm thinking about is getting a shot. So I get my camera out, and when he starts coming at me, I'll edit this so it's kid-friendly. But I actually switched the camera to my left hand so that I could get my Glock 27 out of my ribs pack with my right, but it was just very sloppy because I'm trying to film him and I'm trying to get my gun out and I'm trying to watch him all at the same time. And anyway, I'll have you take a look at this, it's kind of fun. So of course, this is when I first see him. I get the camera right out of the pack. He hasn't seen me yet, but then he turns right here, bam, he sees me. Now it doesn't take him long, lower his head, see him lower his ears. Now, at this point, for some reason, I go into a weird accent and I'm trying to fish my Glock 27 out. Although I do have some good footage of you. Not really because it's so shaky. I think we're just kind of right in his way, there he goes, he's alright. Now what ensues here is me and Uncle Bingo just really enjoying the experience and talking about it, and it's very raw footage guys, it's just kind of a snapshot of this trip and a very unpolished snapshot of that. Is there two of them? Oh yeah, there is. Is it a bull or is it a cow? The thing is, is we're getting into rut season. And that means they get pretty ornery. Not quite though, but close. Looks like they're just doing their thing, I love this man, jeez. Good thing you stopped me, I came charging down the trail, making all kinds of sounds to scare bears, but. Uncle Bingo of course. You would have just took me out. I mean the cars are just right there, that's where the road is. And the bull moose and what we think is a cow. And we're pretty dang close to that bull moose right now. Let's see if I can... He's just right there, he's watching us. He's okay. He's alright. They really blend in if you're not watching. Yeah, they do don't they? As big as they are. Okay, this is what we're going to do. I'm going to film you. You run up, slap his butt, or spray paint it, and run as fast as you can. I'll tape the whole thing, this will be great YouTube footage. This will be like missing the Sasquatch a little bit. Okay, I'm in. Okay. We just forced him in the brush. Now see, I can't tell if he's eating or maybe... Look at this, maybe this is his bed. He's like, hey buddy. Get away from my bed. This is about as close as I dare get. We're probably 20 feet apart with a lot of brush in between us. He seems pretty calm. He's just gone about his business eating again. That's one thing I do, is really watch their body language. And understand where you are too. I know a lot of you guys tell me... I've had several guys in Alaska tell me, you could never do this. In Alaska with the moose that they have. Sorry guys, I'm not filming too well right now. I'm more watching him than trying to film him. Hey look, there's a baby. Awesome. Put him in your pack. What? Got straight up mauled by a cougar. Got on a buffalo. Buffalo sounds. We're approaching moose territory again. And this is our strategy. We've got plenty of sleeping bags. So if he charges us, we use the sleeping bag as a shield, punch him, wrestle him down, hog tie him. Good to go. I could do a drop kick to knock him over. That would be cool. We need to set up the camera though, so we can get it all on tape. Where's your action camera? Do you see that one? The bear one? That's freaking hilarious. He's right there, hanging out. He's the guy in the hat with the cool hat. Knock your hat, but it's not going to save you. Where he knocks the stove over. Knock the stove over on your foot. Ouch.\nComment: Always get a kick out of seeing wildlife in their natural habitat. The moose was pretty cool too ;-)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The bucks are the ones with the brown on their heads - the brown is staining from tree bark as they rub their antlers on trees.  They will be snow white again when they shed their winter coats.  They are not regulars in our neck of the woods so we didn't have the opportunity to see them with their antlers.  We sure would have loved to.  We did get a brief glimpse of the old buck with his wide, palmated antlers.  It seems that as the albino bucks age their antlers get thicker & thicker.  We learned shortly after this filming that the old buck (with the limp) was taken by wolves.  They only came around a few days but we sure enjoyed seeing them.  The big buck especially, who we called Big Al, was absolutely magnificent.

On 08.03.08, this storm hit the US midsection during a year which already had bad storms. The storm is shown in another video, Great Blizzard 2008, Record Breaking, Storm of Century,  video was made one day afterwards. The wildlife were getting hungry. Here two doe and two fawns come up to the bird feeder (they generally inspect it after dark). Although they were very hungry, they were even more curious about the cat. Deer do not appear to understand what domestic animals are and are exceedingly curious.The cat was curious also. The deer kept their distance, but spent some time looking over the cat. One fawn seemed to not be in the best of a mood. It hit its mother with a hoof at least twice (at ~ .46 and 1.2).The deer kept getting closer to the cat by hiding behind the snow drift, then going back to the tree. The snow was so deep that the deer could hardly run through it, when they left.The previous Video begins with view of field and trees taken immediately (~1-2 days) before the storm. Wildlife includes whitetail deer (which are loosing their antlers), wild turkeys, turkey vultures (sighted here for first time of year), and crows. Video then shows blizzard beginning at night. Nighttime animals out included raccoons (only 1 was photographed) and a coyote. These animals were videotaped in infrared. The  storm was getting bad during the coyote filming. Video then shows view of the storm. Only the closest trees were visible during the whiteout, as compared to the normal view of the area. Small snow whirlwinds, tornados, and gusts traveled across the landscape. Snow was cleared here with backhoe.The record breaking snow fall was 20.4 inches. The previous mark in Ohio for snow during 1 storm was 15.3 inches. And this record was made in 1910. Blizzard was compared to the famous blizzard of 1978. Streets were closed, a snow emergency was declared, and plane travel stopped (although I heard a jet while I was filming the coyote). A level 3 snow emergency was declared in many counties. Freeways were closed. Cities had parking bans. Contingents of several snow plows pulled through, some slid off the road. Many accidents occurred. People intending to vacation in warm places were stuck in Ohio.After the storm traffic was still stopped. The streets were used for sledding and snowboarding.Additional views of wild deer on the farm include:LARGE BUCK FIGHT-LOCK ANTLERS, ENTANGLED, CLOSE WHITETAIL  Non-Typical Moose-Sized Buck DEER - ACTION SHOTS RARE WHITE WILD WHITETAIL BUCK  views of this white deer: white deer on the farm -- the banded one & sibling: white deer being stalked by coyotes: strange deer on the farm deer fighting bucks run and jump bucks fighting COYOTES VS.

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: A Growing Population of Mexican Wolves Endangered Mexican wolves are making a comeback in Arizona and New Mexico. Watch as wildlife managers count Mexican wolves to find out if 2014 is a record-breaking year. This video was created by the Information Branch of the Arizona Game and Fish Dept. Producer: David Majure.\nTranscript: December 2014 in the White Mountains of Arizona, a trail cam placed near the carcass of an elk records a pack of Mexican wolves showing up for breakfast. It's nothing unusual, yet it's absolutely extraordinary, especially when you consider that Mexican wolves nearly became extinct. By the early 1970s, there were zero wild Mexican wolves in the United States, and only a smattering could still be found in Mexico. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Mexican wolf as an endangered species in 1976. Today, Mexican wolves are making a comeback in Arizona and New Mexico, thanks to a captive breeding program and a reintroduction project that's been releasing and managing wolves since 1998. It's a partnership between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the Forest Service, the White Mountain Apache Tribe, and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. From the get-go, the goal was a self-sustaining population of at least 100 wolves by 2006. It's taken us almost 10 years after that to even come close to that number. Go find a location on RIM, go find Tsewa, only you're going to be over there on White Mountain. Jeff Dolphin is team leader for Arizona Game and Fish on the interagency field team, which does the day-to-day management of this experimental population of Mexican wolves. Does anybody not know what they're doing tomorrow? At the end of each year, the team does a population survey to find out how many wolves are living in the wild. We've got 10 animals, we're just trying to find 1331. The front seat can just turn the antenna and find the wolf just by turning it that way. They use radio telemetry to search for wolves wearing radio collars. When they find a wolf without a collar, or one that needs a new one, they may try to capture it. Chasing wolves through tall trees in a helicopter is difficult. It's probably some of the most demanding flying I do, just between the terrain, the trees, and trying to follow a running wolf through the trees without running into anything. It's very demanding. And sticking it with a tranquilizer dart is never easy. I'm looking out of the helicopter or muggers on the side trying to locate the wolves with the radio telemetry. What you're witnessing is wildlife management in action. It's unbelievably challenging. You just got to be patient and persistent. And it's infinitely rewarding. All of these wolves right now are wild born, wild raised, and they're surviving on their own. They're not needing help to survive from us. They're doing what we want them to do, but we're really seeing a dramatic incline in the population right now. When a wolf is delivered, the processing team goes to work immediately. Who's doing the microchips? This animal came in pretty hot from the chase and everything else, and through the IV fluids and cold packs, we've actually got her temperature back down to normal. The team documents the wolf's physical characteristics. It provides immunizations, monitors vital signs, and does any doctoring that's needed. So this is pretty much a resolving bite wound. The priority is to get the animal collared and back into the wild as soon and as safely as possible. For three straight years, the Mexican wolf population has increased by at least 10%. But this year's count was better than ever. The 2014 Mexican wolf population survey documented a minimum of 109 wolves in the wild, a 31% increase that finally broke the century mark. We're busting at the seams with wolves right now for this recovery area. With 19 packs and 38 pups, the future is bright for Mexican wolves. And it's only getting brighter. In 2015, big changes to the rules governing the recovery efforts gave Mexican wolves more room to roam. The area they're allowed to occupy in Arizona and New Mexico grew from 7,000 to more than 150,000 square miles. And the goal for the number of wolves more than tripled, from 100 to as many as 325. It's a number the project partners believe will give the wolves the greatest chance of success. A number that strikes a balance between the wolf population, available prey resources, and public acceptance. A number that ensures the Mexican wolf's comeback continues.\nComment: They show more sympathy for animals than people that need help lost in the dessert in search for a \"better life\"."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

She told her to go and to be free and to eat. And that's exactly what she's done, and she's been just a wonderful animal. She's really enjoyed Crackle. Here of late, though, she's been sick. We found her in her den, just being cold and unresponsive, so we brought her into the camp hospital. And our big cat rescuers have been hand-feeding her and giving her lots of attention. She's perked up beautifully, and it's raining outside. So until we have better weather, we'll keep her inside here. We're going to keep her warm and dry. Even the rain doesn't deter people from coming to see the big cats. Of course, most of the big cats don't mind the rain at all.\nComment: Many parts of our jobs are fun, however, many parts are truly hard work.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over.

I'm the director of Genesis Wildlife Conservation Center and the Sanctuary. We began in about 1983, and then it grew from there so that we're now a charity. We collect from the people who come here, donors. Some of it we get from foundations. But we rehab about 600 to 700 birds and animals every year. Most of them are released back to the wild, and some of them can be released to their own environment. Music Because he's so small, he wouldn't really stand a chance out in the wild. Are you guys looking for someone to take him in? No, we keep him and use him for education. You have to have permits to have any of the animals. We have to have federal, state, USDA permits, everything. Music I know. That's why we keep them well padded. All the cages are padded, so when they fall, they only fall to the bedding. That's Samsara. Sam I've had since 1998. Music Such beautiful birds. Sasha is now six months old. She came to us as a baby about five weeks old when the whole nest fell to the ground. Her brother did just fine, and he's already been released. But the female, Sasha, on the x-ray, it shows the right wing just really shattered and not able to pin it. So that's why she stays with us. And we take her around to schools, and we talk about their habitat and the need to preserve it. Music This black and white one down here, though, that has an interesting story because see how her wing droops? That's only part of her injuries. I had released her along with a bunch of other pigeons. And then when she came back, she was in the backyard, like in the middle of February, and it was snow everywhere. And I looked out the back window, and it was just blood everywhere. And I ran out to see what it was, and it was this poor little pigeon. And she had come back to get cared, I guess, or at least it was a safe haven for her. So we treated her. She's blind in one eye. She had a lot of, I mean, her whole side was ripped off. The wing was broken. So I treated her back. She fell in love with the old fantail pigeon. And when the old fantail got sick, she would take care of him. I had him inside in a small cage. She would get up under his wing and walk him to the dinner dish. And her story is that when she was about three weeks old, some kids found her in the bushes, probably while her mom was moving them from one place to another. So she spent the next nine weeks at the animal control, where she was placed in a cage next to dogs and cats. And then she was taken to the vet. So she didn't learn to fear any of us. So that's why she's got to stay with us. I tried to release her a couple times, and it was a failure each time. This one over here is Cali, Calahari. And Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: I love it very good goodnight."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: This may be what you are referring to: The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.

Well, good evening. Welcome to Butch and Wendy's Hunting Adventures. Hawk Hunter Diva decided to go try to get some venison. So we're here in the Hill Country, Texas. The deer are a little smaller up here compared to South Texas or up north, but we have a whole lot of them. I've been sitting in a pop-up blind watching a stream of does and little bucks and stuff. And I was actually after this eight point buck. He was nice and mature, but he didn't come in this morning. And while I was sitting there, this little ten point came in. Well, for the Hill Country, he's a nice little deer. And I decided to go ahead and take him. I had a good hunt. It was nice. And another deal was, the wind wasn't quite blowing right. It's kind of switching around because we have a front coming in. Right now it's 76 degrees here in Central Texas, but tomorrow it's going to be 35 degrees. So actually I was even hunting in shorts this evening. But anyway, the wind was swirling. The deer kept coming in. They were a little spooky. So I'll tell you what I did. I got this Muzzy's Bowhunter set up, the scrape juice, and I sprayed a little bit out the window. And he came in shortly afterwards, but I'll tell you what, don't spray it inside the blind. It smells pretty rough, but I bet deer really like it because I had never seen this buck before out of all the deer I've been watching for the past couple of weeks. And it brought him in, so I guess it works. But have a good evening. Muzzy Phantom did the job, shot him with a crossbow. Central Hill Country of Texas, and it's October 27th, 2010. Y'all have a good evening. We're going to try to go get some more venison here this season, but I guess I'm going to have to change clothes and get something warm. See y'all next time. Later.\nComment: congrats on the deer.  good to see you posting a video!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Humans belong to the taxonomic Order Primates, which is comprised of 11 Families, 52 Genera, & 181 species. Primates are divided into two main groups: Prosimians (literally \"before monkeys/apes) and Anthropoids (literally \"man like\"). The evolution of primates is characterized by trends toward mobile limbs, grasping hands, a flattened face, binocular vision, a large, complex brain, & a reduced reproductive rate. Most Primates are well adapted to arboreal living (living in trees).Primate evolution occurred primarily during the Cenozoic Era, Prosimians first branching off in the early Eocene Epoch 58 mya (million years ago).Around 33 mya, during the Oligocene Epoch, the Anthropoids split off into 3 main groups: New World Monkeys (w/prehensile tails), Old World Monkeys (w/out prehensile tails), & the Hominoids (eventual Apes & Humans w/out any tails).In the Miocene Epoch, around 15 mya, Asian Apes & African Apes diverged paths. At approx. 6 mya, African Apes & Human lineage split, producing Hominids (members of the taxonomic Human Family Hominidae) in a region of Central Africa called the Great Rift Valley. There, dense jungle gave way to great savannah plains, & bipedalism became a helpful adaptation in surviving in a high grass environment w/a variety of predators. To this day, Chimpanzees & Humans share 98.5% of the same DNA sequences, even though millions of years separate us from a common ancestor. The evidence for evolution has been found within the fossil record. Additional corroboration has been found comparing DNA sequences which show dramatic linkages between all modern primate species. A comparative study of mitochondrial DNA shows that the differences among present human populations are consistent w/their having a common ancestor no more than a million years ago.Prosimian (lemurs, tarsiers, bushbabies & lorises)0:26-0:45 Ring Tailed LemurAnthropoids (monkeys, apes & humans)  New World Monkeys (w/prehensile tails)0:52-1:02 Black Tamarin Marmoset1:03-1:10 Squirrel Monkey1:11-1:18 Capuchin Monkey1:19-1:26 Woolly Monkey1:27-2:10 Spider Monkey **1:47-1:51 a spider monkey is investigating/ harassing a river turtle.**1:52-1:57 two spider monkeys are investigating/ harassing an alligator.Old World Monkeys (w/out prehensile tails)2:13-2:36 Vervet Monkey aka Green Monkey or Guenon or Grivet **These are the monkeys scientists have thus far linked as a carrier species for the RNA retrovirus associated w/HIV/AIDS.2:37-3:43 Rhesus Macaque**3:13-3:43 show a troop of rhesus macaques interacting w/Sika & Fallow deer, as well as Mouflon sheep & raccoons.Hominoids (apes & humans, w/out any tail) Asian Apes3:45-3:53 White Handed Gibbon3:54-4:08 OrangutanAfrican Apes4:11-4:32 Lowland Gorilla4:33-4:59 ChimpanzeeHuman4:52-4:59 Me kissing a Chimpanzee ^_^All photographs are the property of Dafttool & cannot be reproduced or used without the expressed authorization of Dafttool.\nTranscript: You You You You We Hey Everyone can see we're together All of the people around us they say Can they be that close?

She was found chained to a wall in a drug house during a law enforcement raid in Tennessee. Because she'd been confined to live on a concrete floor, she had huge swollen masses on her elbows that took months to heal, and was severely underweight. As you can see, she's made a full recovery since being rescued and is now the largest lion we have at the sanctuary, even bigger than our male lions Joseph and Cameron. Because she's such a big girl who just loves to frolic, run around and play, we wanted to provide Nikita with a large addition to her enclosure that she'd be able to explore and enjoy. Big Cat Rescue is situated on 55 acres in Tampa, Florida, and we're home to over 100 rescued exotic cats that were previously unwanted, abandoned or abused. The sanctuary seeks to provide the very best home we can for the cats in our care, and educate the public about the plight of these magnificent animals. The cats' enclosures are created to provide as natural an environment as possible, including trees for our leopards, who love to climb, pools for the tigers, so they can cool off, and even fresh sand for our sand cats to enjoy. So with Nikita in mind, and our goal set in place, we put our Big Cat plan into action. We wanted Nikita's new habitat to include an additional 3,500 square feet. So we needed to build an enclosure addition that measured 50 feet by 70 feet in size, at a cost of approximately $20,000. We put the word out to our supporters, and they definitely roared into action. Big Cat Rescue is fortunate to have supporters around the world who not only enable us to provide for the well-being of the cats, but also that of the sanctuary's fiscal sustainability. Lawrence and Pamela Tristle are two long-time supporters who generously donated half the cost to build Nikita's enclosure expansion as a matching grant, and hundreds of other supporters responded to help meet our goal. The first thing we had to do was make room for the addition, which meant lots of trimming, weeding, root removal, and leveling of the ground. Thanks to volunteers from the U.S. Army Citrus Park Recruiting Station here in Tampa, and of course, Big Cat Rescue volunteers, this was accomplished in record time, while Nikita kept busy watching over all involved. The perimeter of Nikita's new addition was marked out, and construction began. The walls of the enclosure were to be 15 feet in height, with a 5-foot cantilever, making the total height of the enclosure approximately 18 feet. Once all of the posts were in place, over 50 panels were hung, reinforced, cut to size, and then fixed in place. This process took almost three weeks to complete, and I'm sure Nikita was feeling a little sympathetic towards the workers. Then, the big day arrived. The Big Cat transformation was complete. Donors, volunteers, interns, and staff members alike all turned out to see Nikita take her first steps in her new territory. Everything was in place, including Nikita's favorite big yellow boomer ball, as well as a paper mache warthog for her to make friends with. Nikita was definitely ready to explore, while everybody eagerly looked on, and she didn't disappoint. Take a look. Big Cat Rescue would like to thank everyone who made this possible. Nikita may show her appreciation in unique ways, but thanks to our supporters, donors, and volunteers, we've truly enriched the life of this big girl.\nComment: Such a big and pretty spoiled girl :) Just as she should be after an unfair start in life. God bless Big Cat Rescue :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The Coyote Pack is growing. We just hit 50,000 subscribers and it's all because of you. Yes, you, the audience. Keep sharing the videos because the bigger we get, the bigger the adventures get. Stick around, Question of the Week is coming up next. Welcome back. In case you guys missed last week's Behind the Adventure, make sure you check it out. There's still the chance to win those awesome SOG adventure tools. I got some great questions this past week. The one that really stood out came in from Ray Wong. Ray asks, hey Coyote and the crew, I've been wondering how the Coyote Pack is going to grow in the future. How are we going to make it grow in the future? I'm going to tell you how we're going to make it grow. We're going to make it grow in the future. I've been wondering, how long does it take for you guys to produce one of your typical 10 minute episodes? That's a really great question, Ray. And it's tough to answer that one directly because each episode is different. So the crew and I got together and we talked about this and we kind of came upon the number of 48 collective working hours to make one of the 10 minute episodes that you see every single week. And it's different based on animal and location. But there's three different parts that goes into every single episode. Pre-production, production, and post-production. First, let's talk about the pre-production. And it starts with the internet and with field guides. I do a ton of research about the animals that I might want to encounter. And then I start researching the locations that we can travel to to ultimately encounter these animals. Once I figure out what animal it is we want to go after, we start booking our trip and then production begins. Once we actually get on the ground in a location, it can take us days sometimes to find some of these animals. So it's me, it's Mark, it's Chance, it's Melissa, it's my wildlife biologist Mario, and we'll be out there three, four, five days trying to encounter as many animals as we can. So let's say we're in Arizona, we've put together a list of 15 different animals that we want to encounter. We're not gonna see all 15 of these animals. We might see five of those animals and then we might see four or five that we didn't plan on seeing. I've gotta be ready for any situation and any animal at any point in time, which makes it challenging. Once we're there in the environment, and let's say it's a rattlesnake, and we've encountered the rattlesnake and I've caught the rattlesnake, the catch is obviously the most dangerous part. Once I've got the animal in my hands and under control, the camera team can move in close and we begin filming the presentation segment. After we get all of the footage that we needed in the field, then it goes in to post-production. This is a whole different ballgame. This is where you actually put together the puzzle. Now when we come back from a trip, we have anywhere between, I don't know, maybe 40 and 50 hours worth of footage. Think about that, 40 or 50 hours worth of footage that breaks down into these little seven to 10 minute segments. We begin sifting through all of it, finding the best shots, finding the takes that I don't mess up on, and piecing them together. Then comes the sound effects, then comes the music, then comes the color correction, and ultimately, we have a finished episode that we get to upload to YouTube for everyone out there to enjoy. So again, I'd say in total, to put together one of our typical 10 minute episodes, it probably takes about 48 working hours. That was a fantastic question, Ray. Keep writing in every single week. I'll be out here in the field answering your questions. I'm Coyote Peterson. Be brave, stay wild. We'll see you next week. So for me, this is gonna be one heck of an experience. Even though it's a bear that's been raised in captivity for educational purposes, he's an ambassador for his species, it is still a grizzly bear and deserves an incredible amount of respect. I can see it right over my shoulder here and it is big. You're gonna come hiking through this game trail here across this pass. Have a camera down there getting that perspective. Adam will be coming back from that game trail leading to the bushes. There's good cover there, so we can have somebody back there with him. He's gonna come out as you're passing by and he's gonna startle you and you're gonna turn around and you're gonna do what you're supposed to do.\nComment: These​ videos make my day"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: I'm on the southern edge of the Namib Desert. Here, plants can't get water not because it's frozen, but because rain hardly ever falls, only about one or two inches in the whole year. Most of the time, it's bone dry and devastatingly hot. Yet, almost unbelievably, there are trees standing out in the sands, totally unsheltered, with no sign of moisture anywhere around them. Water storage is the great trick here. These green succulent leaves are full of it, and so are these bloated branches. The local bushmen used to cut off these branches and hollow out the spongy tissue and use them as containers for their arrows, which is why this tree is called the quiver tree. Its branches are covered with a blindingly white powder which reflects the heat, and its leaves have thick rinds with very few pores, which minimizes the amount of water they lose through evaporation. The trunk, even of an old tree ravaged by the years, remains smooth and impermeable, but even the quiver tree can't seal itself off totally from its surroundings. Living involves breathing, and some water vapour is inevitably lost in that process. But this tree has a way of reducing that. Self-amputation. It can cut off a leaf rosette and seal the stump. This branch will never grow leaves again, but with luck, the tree will just survive with a reduced number of leaves and put out new shoots when conditions improve.\nComment: David is my hero"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

What a sight.\nComment: @mistulac Hi there...The \"tail up\" posture you see in this video is more of an alarm signal - nothing to do with its need to defecate. In general, this specific posture normally indicates alarm or sexual responsiveness. Either way, it is probably not a good idea for a human to approach the animal if this signal is displayed.

This footage was shot at beautiful Animal Kingdom (Disney) in Orlando, Fl.\nTranscript: The large flying fox is one of the biggest bats in the world. Even though it may weigh, on average, only two pounds, its wingspan can get to around six feet wide. That is one of the reasons this bat belongs to the suborder, megabat. Or as I say, the suborder, MEGABAT! These large bats are just one of many species of flying fox. They get their name due to their heads, which up close, sort of look like a fox with their pointed ears. These large flying fox come from the islands of Southeast Asia. They will roost high up in the trees and they will become active at sunrise and at sunset. So they aren't strictly nocturnal. And since they're considered an old world bat, they also can't echolocate like some other bats can. So they rely on their sense of smell and strong eyesight to locate food. Food for these large bats is pollen, leaves, flowers, and fruits. So you don't have to worry, they're not going to suck your blood. They play an important role where they can take fruit seeds from one island to another to help the fruits grow in new locations. Now unfortunately, they are often seen as pests since they eat flowers and they then are over hunted. These large flying foxes also need a lot of trees and in Southeast Asia, a lot of forests and jungles are being cut down due to the growing human population and a need for more space. The flying fox will usually give birth to just one pup so it's very important to conserve each and every large bat we see. Their young will stay with them for around 12 to 14 weeks and then they become mature enough to go out on their own. For more information on the flying fox, please read this video's description below. And as always, thanks for watching!\nComment: Awe their so cute!

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: Love the video.

By doing this, Kevin hopes to give people an insight into the lives of these beautiful creatures and to let them see just what they can do to help. You can nearly touch them.\nTranscript: So we're going to be taking Georgie and Yami a walk. Let's go. Yeah. Time for a drive. And it's an enrichment walk. We do this with all the lions. It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back.

These baby woodpeckers fell to the ground when the rotten tree that their nest was in was pushed over. In this miraculous story of compassion, Captain Quinn saves the baby birds.\nTranscript: Captain Quinn here. Saving baby birds. Yeah, that's right. Woodpecker, to be exact. Baby woodpeckers. Flickers, to be even more specific. So about a week ago, I was building this chicken coop here, which happens to be crookeder than a witch's nose, but we won't get hung up on that. The chickens don't care. And I noticed this rotten old birch tree, and it was a complete safety hazard. So I pushed it over with my muscles, and when it hit the ground, it exploded right in the center. And I heard, squawk, squawk, squawk! And I looked, and there were seven baby woodpeckers. So I felt terrible, decided I had to do something. You know, like, they have just as much a right to be here as I do. So I gathered them all up in my warm embrace, put them in a shoebox, kept them warm in a dark place, and then did a little research, called an animal rescue helpline, and found out that I can either feed them a diluted mixture of cat food and plain yogurt every half an hour. Well, that's not going to happen. Or I can drive them the two and a half hours to the closest animal rescue shelter. That's also not going to happen. Or, their best chance at survival is to actually put them back in their nest, and put that nest back to where it originally was, so the parents can find them. You see, birds have a very poor sense of smell, but they have a very, very strong bond between the parents and the offspring, just like every other animal, which is pretty powerful, a bond that can't be broken easily. So I decided to reconstruct their nest, put them back in, hoist them back up to roughly the same spot, and see if the parents would come back. The problem was, the nest was in shatters, about 50 different pieces. But, I'm a crafty man, so I grabbed all the pieces, a few screws, hammered the screws into the old rotten tree, and duct taped around it with this clear duct tape, packing tape I think, and put the little critters back in, and tied a rope around the top of the rotten snag, and hoisted her back up, and waited. 15 minutes later, to my delight, one of the parents came back, and went right back in the little hole, and fed their little, you know, their offspring, the little babies. I've been observing these birds for about a week now, and it's pretty magnificent. About every 10 to 20 minutes, one of the parents, the mom or the dad, come back with food. They feed the little youngsters, and then they clean up the nest. They fly out, they're busy, they're at it all day. And it's been very cool getting to watch that. Pretty exciting. And they don't mind having chickens as neighbors, and they don't mind me as a spectator. So, it's been pretty cool. And it's been about a week. They've feathered up, and I check on them every day. They come over here to their home, and I, you know, I just tell them, you know, how are you guys doing? And as you can hear, they're quite little chatterboxes. There's a little hole in here I left so I could peek on them, see how they're doing. They're getting feathers. How are you guys doing? When are you planning on leaving the nest? Huh? Huh? About that time, I think. Oh, hi! I'm now, for scientific purposes, so we can get a better understanding of what exactly goes down in a woodpecker's nest, going to stick the pecker cam down inside Woody Woodpecker's hole. No, this is not a colonoscopy. See, woodpeckers, unlike other birds, have their nests inside hollow, rotten trees. I think, I'm not exactly sure what their plan is here. I don't know if they're going to peck their way out of there or climb up and jump. I'm not sure, but I'll keep you posted on that. But I just thought that, you know, if I can save a baby bird, then so can you. And sometimes, as we are being human and doing human things, we put the lives of animals at risk, and I think that we need to remember that they have a right to be here, just as much, if not more so, than us. So if we do find ourselves in a position where we have jeopardized the life of another living animal, I think we should do everything we can to save it and protect it. I'm Captain Quinn, and that's how to save a baby bird. See you next time. Don't forget to subscribe and tell your friends.\nComment: +Captin Quinn\nYou ROCK!  I've now watched this video a couple of times and your right.  I have not saved baby birds but I did help a coupe of turtles and a mouse.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: Mandi was last seen flying over the local village after successfully finding her first real land mine."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Hi, Rebecca! There's a camper and the Jeep and that's the lake. That's Muska Lounge Lake. Notice how there's not people on top of people on top of people. I guess, I never showed you guys that at the other campground. Anyway, this is a nice campground. And look, grass, not dirt. The campground that we stayed at last weekend, it was all dirt. Every single campsite was dirt. Which is just crazy. So, we're getting ready to head on the road. Head on the road. We're gonna head on the road? Head on the road. Whatever. So, we just left the campground and we are headed to Oswald's Bear Ranch. They have the north, I think the largest collection of black bears, is it? Probably. Largest collection of black bears in the United States. Or at least like on this side of the United States. Cause we were at a black bear ranch one time out west and they had a lot of bears too. I think they had a large collection of bears though, not just black bears. Yeah, I think they had like grizzly bears. Yeah, they had a Kodiak. I remember that. And this guy just has just black bears. So, we're gonna go see some bears. Not you girls. You girls are gonna have to sit in the car with the air conditioner on for a little bit. That's why we have two sets of keys. We're at the bear ranch. There's their dens. And way back there we see a bear. These are the female bears, I believe. There's a big bear right there. Just a walking. They just remind me of dogs. Imagine what it sounds like when they get all playing. Yeah. Probably like Shelby and Oakley. Yeah. Look a bear, panting just like the dogs. We don't have any apples. We didn't buy any apples yet. And don't look like he needs many apples. Pretty cool. What's up dude? What's up? Are you hot? I think these are the females he said. Yeah, and she looks like she could be pregnant. No, they're getting ready for hibernation, Jamie. Oh, that's right. Man, looks like an apple. There's that one sleeping under a tree. There's another one walking down here. I think they said there's seven in this enclosure. They have 29 all together here. Look, another bear. This one just sat down to stare at Rebecca. What do you think, Rebecca? You ever been that close to a bear? No. What are you doing, huh? Just chilling out in there? Just chilling out. She's a little smaller than the last one. Yeah, she is. Oh, look at this one. It reminds me of Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh. Kind of hanging out. Is that comfortable? Sure looks comfortable. Are you a boy? No, that's a girl. Them other ones must have been boys. Look how little she is. She's just a-walking. Looking for food. Here she goes. Looking away. Looking away. She makes a loop. And eyes. Boom. She's looking for an apple. Yeah, she wants to make sure it's not up here. Let's keep walking. We'll go find more. There's lots more. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one's a boy. This one here's sitting up. He's like, Oh, but I wanted an apple. Those people are feeding the bears apples. So they're going to follow them all the way around. They're going to try to anyway. Uh-huh. This one's playing in the water. Didn't think he was going to. Look. King of the mountain. Yep, always balancing. He's going to lay right down in the water. Oh, I bet that feels good. That's funny. Both of them are like, Slowly going. How cool is that? So, where are we? The bear pen. Oswald, the bear pen. Bear pen. Oswald's bear ranch. In Newberry. In Newberry. Yep. Got Rebecca. And a big fence. There's bears in there. There's bears in there. I got some on my list down there too. There's big male bears in there somewhere. Yeah, there's a couple ten year old black bears in here. I don't know. Where are we going next? Fayette. Fayette? Way down to Fayette? I don't know. Are we going to stop there first? Probably stop somewhere first. I have no idea. Uh, seen? Wildlife refuge? Maybe. Maybe we'll do that on the way back for that time. Maybe. Anyway. I was just wondering why I brought this camera. So now you can clip this out. Bye. More bears. I think that was the one we just saw swimming. Oh look, he's going to climb the tree. There he goes. You can do it dude. Get it, get it, get it. It's not as little as it used to be. These are juvenile bears. They're playing back there. Want it? There's your little big truck bear. Come on. Yeah, I think he's a little big for up there. There's one big bear. Check him out. He's pretty big. Well, there's a big boy. What's up big boy? There's another big boy back there. Yeah. The claws will kill you. Oh, big yawn. Oh, baby yawn. What's up, huh? Oh, you gotta get up, huh? Gotta move. No, you can stay. No, that one's yawning. I'm tired too. We're leaving. I hit the camera. We're leaving Oswald's Bear Ranch and now we're heading down to Newberry. That was pretty cool. If you're ever up here and you're thinking about whether or not you should stop, you should stop. Cause I had fun. Did you have fun? I had fun. Did you have fun, Rebecca? Yes, I had fun. And the dogs did well sitting in the car. We didn't leave them for too long. So, on to Newberry, I guess. It was neat to see all the bears playing. Yeah, we got some cool video we'll show you guys. And I guess if you're gonna go, you gotta go early in the morning while they're out moving around. Yeah, cause once it gets hot, they're not... They don't like to be out. Why are you in my face? Put in my face. Jamie's outside putting air in the camper tires and the Jeep tires. We got one dog. We got two dogs. We got all three dogs. There's camper. Can't see it cause the window's really dirty. There's Jamie. He just put air in the tires.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over.

You don't see many mammals, far fewer than in African or South American forests. But what this place lacks in mammals, it makes up for in birds. Not that it's all that easy to see them. You know they're around because you can hear them. But if you want to watch them, you have to move fairly quietly. And there is one of the smallest of the whole family. This is the one with those extraordinary sawtooth plumes, the King of Saxony's bird. There's nothing else remotely like these plumes in the whole of the bird world. He's calling for a female. And it's not just his plumes that are unique. So is his way of dancing. This is the King of Saxony, and this is his wife, the Queen of Saxony. That hissing noise is his calling. You can tell he's getting particularly excited because he's erected the black feathers on his shoulders into a cape, another of those transformation tricks that seem to be a speciality of this family.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: :-( I'm sorry.  Hope you get some relief from the pain."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: I long for the day when clear cutting rain forest will be seen as a crime against the planet."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Video Evidence of Taxpayer Dollars Wasted on Everglades Bridging & Water Pollution Killing Wildlife The news stations and public have been misinformed about the water flowing south through the new 81 to 100 million dollar one mile bridge. The fact is that not a drop has been let through as of yet; the water is too polluted according to National Park regulations to run it south through the National Park. The question is if the water is flowed south will it be able to flow through the National Park the majority of the year? Now a 2.6 mile bridge is in sight, and additional 2.9 miles of bridging to proceed it. The problem we see is that the first 1 mile bridge has not yet been tested. The truth to the whole matter is, the Everglades biggest problem lies up north with pollution that should be corrected before spending taxpayers money on a science project that will be a permeant costly disaster if it does not work.We have studied the water flow patterns through the existing culverts for many decades. We have seen how the wildlife has been affected and have analyzed the situation as a whole. The ecosystem and wildlife is disappearing and suffering. Wildlife is becoming smaller in size, becoming weaker, and natural life spans are getting shorter. In 1998 a florida panther was found dead in Everglades Shark River Slough with levels of mercury so high it could kill an adult human.Right now and for the past several months before the 81 to 100 million dollar bridge was even finished water has actually been flowing through the National Park from south to north through the existing culverts; yes, backwards because the water is too polluted. Everyday a test by one of us has been conducted on the bridge to test the direction of the water flow. A hand full of sand is dropped at the opening, but it sinks straight to the bottom. If the flow of water was flowing south the sand would visibly be carried in that direction. Imagine 2.6 miles of water flowing backwards, (yes north) verses the culverts that are in place now. That equals a lot more water traveling north because water pollution regulations do not permit them to flow south through the National Park. Also sending water south would require permission from the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, which owns lands south of Lake Okeechobee and north of Everglades National Park. The Miccosukee Tribe is against the polluted waters being flowed into their land, and they are taking action to preserve their way of life. They would not be able to survive if the water and food is all poisoned. According to Earth Justice the pumps for polluted water on average contribute the equivalent of 60,000 one hundred pound bag of phosphorus to Lake Okeechobee each year.If the bridging is in place unnatural water depths will follow unnatural hydro-periods and water flow patterns. Now all the wildlife's hammocks will be under water, and there will be no dry land. This will result in unhealthy conditions. More water, more water, more water, is not the answer; Clean water, clean water, clean water, is the answer! Because of being in a hurry to build all these bridges that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars are we really going to sacrifice one environment to stop salt water intrusion down south into the bay? Remember there's only one Everglades and its all connected. All these bridges do not save the Everglades, they flood and pollute them more then they already are. We are affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. We have to treat the source of infection instead of covering it up with a bandaid.\nTranscript: Here we are west of the 2.6 mile bridge proposed area at the S333 lock. Water is not flowing into the Tamiami Trail Canal, the lock is closed. Here we are south of that lock. The water is traveling from the west to the east in the canal south of Tamiami Trail. These overflow pipes were located in this area and removed. When water levels would reach the height of the top of the pipe would flow into the pipe. They would act as an overflow and then flow water south into the canal, flowing the water into the National Park. The water now is flowing at a much more rapid rate into the National Park. The problem is it is making a U-turn and finding the path of least resistance due to sawgrass and a southern ridge. It is making a U-turn and flowing north instead of south. The opposite of what it is supposed to do. As the water flows north it travels through these pipes, culverts that flow into the Tamiami Trail Canal. This area is the center of the 2.6 mile proposed bridge. A bridge located here instead of the culverts would flow way more water north, completely drying out the south. You can see the rapid flow rate with three culverts. Imagine a bridge drying out and creating an unnatural drought south of the Tamiami Trail, interrupting the natural process of this part of the Everglades. Wildlife would suffer. Wildlife has already suffered enough due to over 25 years of held water in these areas and too much water and now more water is proposed, over 2 feet more in the canal. As of right now the National Park does not flow water south due to over 10 parts per billion of water pollution regulations. They have not been able to flow water south even through the one mile bridge. Here you can see water rapidly flowing north through these culverts, the area and center of this 2.6 mile bridge. This is not where the bridge should be located. During droughts this area has always flowed water north. Instead of here, the S3334 locks, when opened, create a suction that even increases drastically the water flow north from the south side, drying up the area even faster. Look at the flow going north into the Tamiami Trail Canal. The Everglades does not travel north, should not travel north. Man has interrupted water flows all over the entire Everglades and we are going to do it again with an irreversible situation and billions of taxpayer dollars. This is where the 2.6 mile bridge would be located. The locks at 3333 are closed. The water is traveling south down the L67 Canal making a U-turn and going back north you can see here on the map. The Blue Shanty, the new river, allowing large amounts of water flow north. This is the S3334 lock area. It is also closed. When opened and water flows south, this creates that suction, vacuum, dropping the water sometimes overnight or days, 6 to 8 inches. Unnatural, completely, not allowing the wildlife to adapt. This is not what is supposed to happen with the bridging. The bridging has to be thought about. The 1 mile bridge has not flowed a drop of water south ever since finished. The public has completely been misinformed. Taxpayer dollars are not at work. The 100 million dollar bridge has not worked. We have stopped and checked this area 3 to 4 times a week with a simple test. Water is not flowing in any direction and has not. When the lock is opened at the S333, it will flow south but sawgrass will clog the area restricting lots of flow. And again, taxpayer dollars will not be well spent. And right now, we must at least test the 1 mile bridge before creating more bad decisions. Another 2.6 mile bridge and maybe even more bridging. Bridge is not working right now. It has not for many, many months. The only way to make this water flow south is to create an unnatural level in the canal which will flow and flood the area, being detrimental and terrible for wildlife, especially mammal life. Heavy pollution coming from the north will kill aquatic life, affecting the food chain. This is not the Everglades restoration. This is the Everglades destruction.\nComment: Update: Inside official source confirms that the new Everglades one mile bridge is not achieving the results that were expected. Also water is still flowing from South to North in the area of the proposed 2.6 mile bridge."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: Man, that just ain't fair. You go through all the trouble of planting a land mine in just the right place, and then you get RATTED out."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets. A female red fox is known as a vixen, and a male red fox is known as a dog fox; a fox baby is known as a kit or cub.\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: Lovely girl, beautiful babies."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Local companies donate them after christmas so we literally get trailers full of christmas trees, so we can \"recycle\" them a a different way, check out our video \"Christmas Tree Massacre\" for more tree action :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The lionesses haven't made a successful kill in days. All three are producing milk. They need to replenish their reserves. Kali splits off from the pride, while mother and Ani hide the cubs. She heads to a narrow island that sits just above the water table. In winter, grass above the water line dries out. It's perfect camouflage for a tawny coat. And dry ground is the lechwe's achilles heel, the long hooves that make them fast in the water slow them down on terra firma. The lioness can clock nearly 40 miles per hour on hard ground, but she can only sprint for 100 yards. She has to close the gap between them before she attacks. Kali's impatient. She closes in too fast. The lechwe uses the head start to bolt for the water. Again, the swamp defeats her.\nComment: @iPriestHolmes I think mkocja5a is referring to the commentary from 1:19 - 1:30."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: Ya I may be able to get the footage with my dad's gopro :/"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Walking around you can gaze upon some of the more amazing animals from around the world. From some of the largest to the downright deadly. Zoos offer the average Joe, and his family, a glimpse into the wonders of the natural world. The zoo can trace its origins back to a more family unfriendly time, to ancient Egypt, when for the pharaoh, owning a hippo zoo was completely normal. It was only into the 19th century when the roaring industrial masses wanted a piece of the action, and science was taking off that the modern zoo was born. And sure, zoos have received bad press in the past, but the modern zoo has been reinvented as a centre of science and conservation. So what are the roles of a modern zoo? Well, roughly speaking, we can divide them into three categories, education, breeding centres, and research. So let's start with education. It's simple really, zoos are a fun and safe place to learn for both kids and adults. The fact is, the animals are real, and you can get up and close to some of the more exotic and threatened creatures from around the world. Every year, 150 million people visit zoos around the world, and it's so important that the next generation is educated and understands the role they play in preserving our planet. Better still, many zoos have education centres with dedicated teams who aim to teach kids about everything from ecosystem services to climate change. Zoos also play an important role as breeding centres. Most zoos these days are part of organisations set up to coordinate breeding programmes and keep standards high. This means your favourite animal like the chimpanzee here is probably part of some national or even international breeding programme. These help zoos maintain genetic diversity and are extremely important for species that are threatened with extinction in the wild. One example is the scimitar-horned oryx. This is a species that became extinct in the wild and only survived in zoos and private collections. It is now part of several international breeding programmes and the hope is one day it will be reintroduced into the wild. And finally, Zoos offer a unique opportunity for biologists. Instead of spending days trying to track down an animal and becoming exhausted in the process, zoos offer a more controlled environment where effective research can be undertaken. Take the devastating disease chytridiomycosis. This has caused dramatic declines and even extinction in at least 200 species of frog. Zoos are actively taking part in research aiming to stop the spread of this disease. Research in zoos contribute to a number of scientific fields including animal behaviour and endocrinology, all ultimately contributing to the conservation of our biodiversity. So sure, a trip to the zoo is a great family day out, but zoos these days aren't there to show off your new hippo. Zoos are centres for conservation, educating the new generation, giving critically endangered species another chance and helping us gather knowledge for the conservation of species and biodiversity.

Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old. River Otters was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro / South Florida 2014.\nTranscript: ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪\nComment: Was I the only one who thought an alligator was going to eat an otter?

Big Cat Rescue is situated on 55 acres in Tampa, Florida, and we're home to over 100 rescued exotic cats that were previously unwanted, abandoned or abused. The sanctuary seeks to provide the very best home we can for the cats in our care, and educate the public about the plight of these magnificent animals. The cats' enclosures are created to provide as natural an environment as possible, including trees for our leopards, who love to climb, pools for the tigers, so they can cool off, and even fresh sand for our sand cats to enjoy. So with Nikita in mind, and our goal set in place, we put our Big Cat plan into action. We wanted Nikita's new habitat to include an additional 3,500 square feet. So we needed to build an enclosure addition that measured 50 feet by 70 feet in size, at a cost of approximately $20,000. We put the word out to our supporters, and they definitely roared into action. Big Cat Rescue is fortunate to have supporters around the world who not only enable us to provide for the well-being of the cats, but also that of the sanctuary's fiscal sustainability. Lawrence and Pamela Tristle are two long-time supporters who generously donated half the cost to build Nikita's enclosure expansion as a matching grant, and hundreds of other supporters responded to help meet our goal. The first thing we had to do was make room for the addition, which meant lots of trimming, weeding, root removal, and leveling of the ground. Thanks to volunteers from the U.S. Army Citrus Park Recruiting Station here in Tampa, and of course, Big Cat Rescue volunteers, this was accomplished in record time, while Nikita kept busy watching over all involved. The perimeter of Nikita's new addition was marked out, and construction began. The walls of the enclosure were to be 15 feet in height, with a 5-foot cantilever, making the total height of the enclosure approximately 18 feet. Once all of the posts were in place, over 50 panels were hung, reinforced, cut to size, and then fixed in place. This process took almost three weeks to complete, and I'm sure Nikita was feeling a little sympathetic towards the workers. Then, the big day arrived. The Big Cat transformation was complete. Donors, volunteers, interns, and staff members alike all turned out to see Nikita take her first steps in her new territory. Everything was in place, including Nikita's favorite big yellow boomer ball, as well as a paper mache warthog for her to make friends with. Nikita was definitely ready to explore, while everybody eagerly looked on, and she didn't disappoint. Take a look. Big Cat Rescue would like to thank everyone who made this possible. Nikita may show her appreciation in unique ways, but thanks to our supporters, donors, and volunteers, we've truly enriched the life of this big girl.\nComment: That is wonderful.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: No I don't want this to happen.

It was run as a cattle ranch and given to my parents in 1952 and handed over to Jane and I in 1977 to run. It was purely a cattle operation. 1983 Anna Mertz came to Lewa and offered to develop a rhino sanctuary on Lewa. I, Jane, we had a strong affiliation with wildlife and it was a wonderful opportunity for us to do something new and different and Lewa was the right place. So between 1983 and 1995 we looked after rhino in a very small area. 1995 we established a charitable organisation, the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, because everything was growing and we realised we had to go bigger if we were going to save rhino, that it was more about people and politics and money and all the dynamics around conservation than a single species. Lewa Downs as such, the ecological unit of Lewa Downs is 62,000 acres. Some of that is a national forest reserve owned by government. The rest of that land is owned by different parts of my family and as a family we all know that we have a massive responsibility in caring for that land, for caring for the Grevy's zebra, for the black rhino on that land. Like every family in the world, we have children, we want to pass on what we own to our children and it's a threat to Lewa. It's going to divide the core ownership of it and so my brother, my sister and I have come together and with the support of my parents and said let's put this into an organisation that's going to take it beyond us and TNC have guided us carefully over the last two years through that process and so the land that's been in my family since 1922 will be in a Kenya-based charitable organisation focused on conservation that will take our work into the foreseeable future. Once TNC made the decision to come into Africa, I think there was a sort of gravitational connection there. There was an obvious connection in a lot of key issues that where we were weak and TNC was strong. We were ground-based, we were relatively humble, we had the buy-in of the communities and the government but we didn't have an international reach and we didn't have the expertise, the technical expertise to sort of formalise a lot of the issues that we were doing here on the ground. It's this expertise that's evolved and is available within TNC and that's what's been so valuable to us in this relationship.

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: The video is filled with such interesting scenes..It was an awesome sight at 0.27 with the Bison crossing it was like a scene from a movie..The variety of other animals in the park makes it an entertaining place to visit.

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: I love how this is making a big difference: catching poachers, showing population of rare species, and just an overall cool thing. It is sad about how habitat destruction is a thing and poachers are a thing and they need to stop.\n\n\n2 sentence on a video: Check"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

I also interacted with the fauna of the ecosystem, including snappers, bluegills, and cormorants, who were busy hunting fish. This experience stands out as one of my favorite wildlife encounters to date. The manatees are so friendly, and genuinely seem to appreciate your company. They eagerly seek out belly-rubs and scratches in the same way my dog does. It was so much fun hanging out with them. Unfortunately, I also saw scars on the backs of nearly every manatee in the springs. The animals get hurt or killed from run-ins with boats in the Florida waterways. Only 5,000 or so of these amazing animals remain in the wild. This was filmed with GoPro Hero2 and Hero3 cameras, filmed at either 1080p or 2.7k, 30fps, using the ProTune setting. All filming and editing was done by William Drumm. Editing was in GoPro CineForm Studio and Final Cut Pro X.

Cast Robert and Bindi Irwin.      Crew; Producer: Tom Armstrong, Camera Operator: Ryan Mooney, Sound Recordist: Scott Mulready. Editor: Lucy Garrick, Graphics: Matt White.\nTranscript: This is our gorgeous white rhino, Kai. Although he may look really big and tough, he's actually as sweet as a puppy dog. Well what Kai does is he's actually got a big mud bath in his enclosure. It's pretty cool. He gets a bit dirty. Sometimes when he has that mud all over him, he loves it if you can just pick it off and scratch. It just kind of feels like a massage. They have that mud on their back to help them as like a sunscreen and a mosquito repellent. They actually can't see really well. But Robert, what can they do? They have really, really good hearing. And what's funny about Kai is if you look just on his ears, he's got those little tufts of fur. Isn't that silly? We're not really sure why he has it. Maybe it's to keep the dust out of his ears. This is the white rhino. And they're different from their cousin, the black rhino, for a few different reasons. Firstly, these guys are grazers. So if you look at their mouth, they have that real rectangular shape and really big squishy lips. That's because they eat things like grass. But if you compare them to their cousin, the black rhino, they have a more triangular shaped mouth, don't they? Yeah. It's really pointy. And do you know why they have that? That's because they eat different foods. It's true. So they eat more like things like shrubs. Yeah, so rhinos can actually grow up to be two tons. They're really, really heavy. It's true. Now, the poor rhinos are in a lot of trouble. They're actually critically endangered because of that gorgeous horn. That horn is made out of keratin, which is the same as our fingernails. What people do is they'll kill the rhinos for that horn to turn it into traditional medicine. The biggest thing to protect rhinos or any wildlife is to never, ever buy wildlife products. Kai is one of our biggest animals here at Australia Zoo. But we have lots more, both big and small. So make sure you tune in next time. Yeah, and remember to subscribe to the Pet Collective channel.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: iFly TV: Inspiring People Katherine Conner of BLES iFly KLM Magazine travels to Thailand to interview Katherine Conner who devotes her life to the wellbeing of elephants.\nTranscript: When people travel to Thailand, the thing that they want to do is to see an elephant, to ride an elephant, to feed an elephant. What a lot of people don't realize is the abuse that builds up to allowing that elephant to allow you to mount its back and to ride it. Many female elephants, when they give birth, they will actually kill their calves. And I feel that that is because they know what kind of life that baby is going to have and they don't want the baby to go through it. So they would rather just kill it as soon as it's born. It's a chain of cruelty that we have to stop right now. And the people who can stop it are the tourists coming to Thailand. They are the ones with the power. I am Catherine Connor, the founder of Bunlok Elephant Sanctuary Bless in Sukhothai, Thailand. Here, our number one priority is the elephant's welfare. We're not interested in profit. We're not interested in keeping the tourists happy. We just want to make a difference to the lives of these abused elephants. The rhythm here is beautiful. It's slow. We work on elephant time. You know, when the elephants want to go, we follow. If they want to stop and graze, we wait. And I think that for a lot of people who come here, it's a whole different world. It's a whole different way of looking and dealing with life. And I think that we change people when they come here. Here we have Phang Noi and Phang Soi. And behind you, you have Wassana, Lotus and Phang Dao. And they are collectively known as the Gossip Girls because they are non-stop trumpeting, roaring, squeaking, purring. You see, normally the cameras are all on them. People are wondering when it's going to be their turn. I have always had a passion for animals. And when I came to Thailand, I knew I wanted to see elephants. I began to volunteer at an elephant center in North Thailand. And I met a baby elephant called Bunrot, which is Thai for survivor. That baby elephant reached out and touched me. He changed my life forever. If he hadn't have died, I'm not sure I would have created BLAST because I would have just all my attention and all my focus and all my funds would have been going on to him. Elephants in Thailand, they were always held in very high regard. They were used for logging. And in 1989, Thailand banned that. And so what happened was thousands of elephants and their owners were unemployed. So what do they do? They're not going to give up their elephant. They need to provide for their family. That is when elephant tourism was born. Elephants are forced to perform tricks and the training that goes on to achieve that is diabolical. They're put through a breaking process. The baby elephant is stabbed repeatedly and beaten repeatedly until the spirit is broken. What it then becomes is a machine for the tourist trade. This is Bunthong. We found her in a tourist camp in Pattaya, giving trekking rides. So that means she had that big heavy chair on her back. As a result of years of doing that, she has a broken back. This is Wassana. She stood on a landmine when she was illegally logging on one of the Thai borders. Despite the fact that she is missing parts of her front foot, she was still sold into the tourist trade and forced to give rides. I mean at the end of the day, I don't think any of us are cruel. And I think most of the cruelty that goes on with elephants in Thailand is lack of education. I think most of these elephant owners don't know the damage that they're doing to their elephant's spine and joints. If they knew, I would hope that they would stop. At Bless, we have three guest houses that sleep two people each. We charge people to stay here. We have no programme, no schedule. We never encourage our guests to approach the elephant, encroach on their space. Our vision is to rescue the abused elephants, to recuperate them, to teach them how to be elephants again and then to release them onto protected land where they can live as wild elephants again. One of the biggest things for me, the thing that amazes me about them the most, is their ability to forgive. You know, these elephants, all of them have been abused by us, by humans. And yet, here they are, comfortable, accepting us, allowing us into their space, allowing us to walk along beside them. I just find that incredible.\nComment: 2020 when Covid-19 pandemic has occurred that brings many change to the elephants in Thailand in better way.  I hope when everything back to normal there will be no chain, no saddle on their backs anymore."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The hyenas moo to show affection like a cat purrs.  Then they laugh when getting ready to eat.   They are one of the most intelligent and powerful animas in the world.  Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not.

Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Flavio is a retired circus tiger and to the best of our knowledge he's 23 years old!

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: thank you for putting light on this topic that most people aren't aware of. it's sick what people will do for $, and are praised for their notoriety?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five.

We're not too far away. We had a good frost last night, so it was able to freeze a lot of the blood on the leaves and in the soybean field. We've been able to track it very easily up until it got into this thick cover. I think we're pretty close. It's starting to clot up.

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: The numbers break my heart and make me feel powerless."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: @NaturesFairy Yeah they kept coming over the hill non stop...

I haven't seen anything I wanted to fling an arrow at yet. I'm in the antler hunting mode. So I got some new stuff from Buzzy. It's called Bowhunter Setup Scrape Juice. So I'm going to test that out today and see if I can't bring in something new. I see something just jumped the fence and I haven't seen it before. So let's check it out and see if he's a shooter. Well, good evening. Welcome to Butch and Wendy's Hunting Adventures. Hawk Hunter Diva decided to go try to get some venison. So we're here in the Hill Country, Texas. The deer are a little smaller up here compared to South Texas or up north, but we have a whole lot of them. I've been sitting in a pop-up blind watching a stream of does and little bucks and stuff. And I was actually after this eight point buck. He was nice and mature, but he didn't come in this morning. And while I was sitting there, this little ten point came in. Well, for the Hill Country, he's a nice little deer. And I decided to go ahead and take him. I had a good hunt. It was nice. And another deal was, the wind wasn't quite blowing right. It's kind of switching around because we have a front coming in. Right now it's 76 degrees here in Central Texas, but tomorrow it's going to be 35 degrees. So actually I was even hunting in shorts this evening. But anyway, the wind was swirling. The deer kept coming in. They were a little spooky. So I'll tell you what I did. I got this Muzzy's Bowhunter set up, the scrape juice, and I sprayed a little bit out the window. And he came in shortly afterwards, but I'll tell you what, don't spray it inside the blind. It smells pretty rough, but I bet deer really like it because I had never seen this buck before out of all the deer I've been watching for the past couple of weeks. And it brought him in, so I guess it works. But have a good evening. Muzzy Phantom did the job, shot him with a crossbow. Central Hill Country of Texas, and it's October 27th, 2010.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Flavio is a real beauty and is obviously a very special Tiger with a super sweet personality!!! I'm sad to see that Flavio has died since this wonderful video was taken of him. I'm grateful to Big Cat Rescue for taking Flavio in and making his golden years so peaceful, quiet and relaxed. Thank you to everyone at BCR for showing Flavio such respect and for showering him with love!!! You guys are the best!!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Containing 2 recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern Canada to central Mexico, including most of the contiguous United States. The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semi-desert, urban edge, forest edge, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but populations are vulnerable to local extinction by coyotes and domestic animals. With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized genus Lynx. It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about twice as large as the domestic cat. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby (or \"bobbed\") tail, from which it derives its name.Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares, it hunts insects, chickens, geese and other birds, small rodents, and deer. Prey selection depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months.Although bobcats have been hunted extensively by humans, both for sport and fur, their population has proven resilient though declining in some areas. The elusive predator features in Native American mythology and the folklore of European settlers.Tags: Are bobcats dangerous, difference between bobcat and lynx, do bobcats kill people, what does a bobcat look like, what do bobcats eat, can a bobcat be trained, can a bobcat be a pet, can you hunt bobcat, can you eat bobcat, does bobcat taste good, how big are bobcats, bobcat vs lynx, bobcat vs mountain lion, what sound does a bobcat make, do bobcats meow, How to call a bobcat, how to call a coyote, how to call a mountain lion, how to call a cougar, bobcat footage, bobcat hunting, coyote hunting, cougar hunting, mountain lion hunting, predator hunting, predator calling, how to use a mouse squeaker, wild cat footage, wildcat footage, bobcat in the wild, lynx footage, is a bobcat a lynx, is a lynx a bobcat, what’s the difference between a lynx and a bobcat?, bobcat characteristics, bobcat behavior\nTranscript: okay so so so ah so so so so so so are you gonna shoot that\nComment: Thank you so much for not kill this big cat.

Big Cat Rescue recently installed a solar power system thanks to the generous support of The Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, TECO-Tampa Electrical and Solar Energy Management. We're so happy that the sanctuary was given the opportunity to help save the planet by utilizing green energy sources and we hope to expand in the future!Check in on our solar power system here:  Energy Management:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Big Cat Rescue is going greeeeen! What? What does this mean? Oh. Big Cat Rescue decided to do our part to help save the planet by installing a solar power system. The installation was made possible by grants from the Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, and a solar electric rebate from TECO. The overall cost of the installation was $18,250. It took the team from Solar Energy Management around three days to install the system. They have to make sure that the solar panels are at the optimal angle so they can capture as much energy as possible from the sun. Throughout the installation, the team were constantly supervised by the cats. In particular, Joseph and Sasha. And, of course, TJ the tiger who was very interested in what was happening around him. For the projected 25-year life of the system, annual utility savings are expected to average around $1,542. So this will total to over $38,000 in savings. And just as importantly, carbon dioxide emissions that will be saved over the life of the system is projected at 157 tons, which is equivalent to driving 314,000 automotive miles. The sanctuary will be using the energy to power all of our pool pumps. So our tigers will have a place to cool off. Max the bobcat can take the occasional dip. And we can constantly replace the water that TJ splashes out of his pool. Plus, any excess power goes backwards through the electrical meter and is supplied to the main office building. Solar Energy Management generously donated two extra panels to the sanctuary. So instead of 20 panels, we have 22. And all 22 individual modules have their own microinverter underneath the panel. What's a microinverter, you might ask? And that's the box right here. And that's the box right here. So the advantages to the microinverter technology are if partial shading occurs or bird droppings fall on a panel and it degrades the performance of this panel, it doesn't affect any of the rest of the panels, so you can maximize power production. And the data collected by all 22 microinverters is transferred to the communication gateway, which then verifies that they're functioning and transmits the data, which is collected every five minutes, wirelessly to the main office where we can check on their status. You can actually monitor the output and production from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. On the webpage, you can check that all the panels are functioning correctly, see how much energy they've produced over different periods of time, and see the environmental benefits to date, such as how the energy could be used. And you can even see how many trees we've saved with our carbon offset. We're so pleased that we've been able to take our first step towards using green energy, thanks to the generous support of several organizations. Our solar panel system is also very easy to add on to, so we hope to do this in the future and continue to do our part for the environment. And I'm sure TJ will enjoy the entertainment.

These are cats that were abandoned, abused, neglected, discarded etc. Cheetah's are harder for people to get as pets. That means there are not usually any being discarded.

It was run as a cattle ranch and given to my parents in 1952 and handed over to Jane and I in 1977 to run. It was purely a cattle operation. 1983 Anna Mertz came to Lewa and offered to develop a rhino sanctuary on Lewa. I, Jane, we had a strong affiliation with wildlife and it was a wonderful opportunity for us to do something new and different and Lewa was the right place. So between 1983 and 1995 we looked after rhino in a very small area. 1995 we established a charitable organisation, the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, because everything was growing and we realised we had to go bigger if we were going to save rhino, that it was more about people and politics and money and all the dynamics around conservation than a single species. Lewa Downs as such, the ecological unit of Lewa Downs is 62,000 acres. Some of that is a national forest reserve owned by government. The rest of that land is owned by different parts of my family and as a family we all know that we have a massive responsibility in caring for that land, for caring for the Grevy's zebra, for the black rhino on that land. Like every family in the world, we have children, we want to pass on what we own to our children and it's a threat to Lewa. It's going to divide the core ownership of it and so my brother, my sister and I have come together and with the support of my parents and said let's put this into an organisation that's going to take it beyond us and TNC have guided us carefully over the last two years through that process and so the land that's been in my family since 1922 will be in a Kenya-based charitable organisation focused on conservation that will take our work into the foreseeable future. Once TNC made the decision to come into Africa, I think there was a sort of gravitational connection there. There was an obvious connection in a lot of key issues that where we were weak and TNC was strong. We were ground-based, we were relatively humble, we had the buy-in of the communities and the government but we didn't have an international reach and we didn't have the expertise, the technical expertise to sort of formalise a lot of the issues that we were doing here on the ground. It's this expertise that's evolved and is available within TNC and that's what's been so valuable to us in this relationship.

Your generosity (the entire family's that is) is quite an example and sadly bit rare these days, so Thank you. Can I suggest that this piece should have links added/shown to other pertinent pieces, web sites, articles, films, videos, books or whatever. This could help interested folks in keeping up to date or in touch with developments. Also add how on can visit Lewa, and or contribute in some way - fiscally or otherwise.

They suspect that poachers killed their mother for her pelt. At first, everyone thinks they're leopard cubs. It turns out they're the rarest of finds. Two clouded leopard cubs. The find captures the imagination of top Indian wildlife photographer Sandesh Kadur. Cats have always fascinated me, and when I heard about these clouded leopards being rehabilitated back into the wild, I dropped everything and rushed to the spot to document the whole process. In terms of filming a new species of cat, I mean, this was it. This is the holy grail. Clouded leopards are amazing creatures, the smallest of the big cats. Shy and elusive, even cat specialists know little about their habits in the wild. Just keeping them alive is a big challenge. A leading vet, Dr. Bhaskar Chowdhury, takes charge of caring for these very special cubs. That was the first experience for me to see wild clouded leopard cubs for the first time in my life. So I was really excited and also a bit nervous because the onus is on us, the veterinarians, to make them survive. Bhaskar is determined that the cubs don't end up in the zoo like most orphaned big cats. He gets permission to try something totally unprecedented, to teach clouded leopard cubs how to be wild. It's totally new, never been tried, never been tested, and people, you know, many scientists won't believe this. It's a huge gamble. If his new protocol succeeds, it will boost dwindling numbers of clouded leopards in their real home, the forest. If they get it wrong, the cubs will die.\nComment: It's extremely sad as these lil ones have a fight for life right from birth. And really ya think that something might be done with these poachers.

Sure, it was the number one dishwashing brand, the biggest advertiser in the category, and sported some of the highest equity ratings of all consumer goods in the country. So what's the problem, you ask? What we haven't mentioned yet is that we're the most expensive brand. Consumers spend an average of 18 seconds at shelf and tend to make rational decisions based on price. So Dawn had to turn to something it has, something our competition will never have, a commitment to saving wildlife cotton oil spills. The best part about it is the fact that it isn't some invented marketing ploy. It's the one and only cleaner wildlife experts have been using to clean animals' cotton oil spills for more than 30 years. Why? Because Dawn is tough enough to cut through grease, even natural disaster-type grease, while being gentle enough to clean the delicate skins of these animals, as you can see in our national TV commercial. Wildlife rescue workers open up a lot of Dawn, tough on grease, yet gentle. Dawn helps open something even bigger. This year, Dawn is also donating $1 million. Learn more at Dawn Saves Wildlife. The centerpiece of our effort was a nine-part documentary series, The Big Picture, shown only online. The series showed the everyday threats to wildlife and explained what people could do about it. The Big Picture could be seen on dawnsaveswildlife.com and YouTube. Pelicans are one of California's big success stories. They just came off the endangered species list in 2009. They're thriving despite all of these issues that they're still having to deal with. Pelicans are prehistoric creatures. This is an animal that's evolved over time and is specific for plunge-feeding fish. When people feed them, they stop doing what they do naturally and start looking in the dumpsters. What happens with that is they become dirty. The biggest problem that it causes is it contaminates their feathers. And that ability to be waterproof, it can make them hypothetical. At the end of the day, they have to be cleaned. We have the product that does it, and it works better than anything. Dawn. Paid media drove people to the micro-site. The micro-site encouraged consumers to share with their friends on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. We use social media to update our fans on the program, sharing each new episode, and sharing the results of the micro-site. The micro-site is a place where you can share with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. It's a new episode and enabling consumers to show their support for the cause. When our consumer got to the store, she was drawn to images of wildlife on shelf displays, end aisle caps, and, of course, on the limited-edition bottle labels themselves. The campaign was picked up by news channels like CNN, Good Morning America, Huffington Post, and People magazine. Rob Lowe made special appearances talking about his support of the program and his role as narrator. There are countless little ways to help save wildlife that make a big difference, from volunteering at your local wildlife shelter to attending events like National Wildlife Day. You can share this video series with family and friends, even things you can do at home, like shopping with reusable cloth bags and washing your dishes with Dawn.

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.

Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: River Otters vs Alligators 03 Music  Otters are semi-aquatic, slender, long-bodied mammals which are specialized for capturing prey in the water. Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old. River Otters was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro / South Florida 2014.\nTranscript: ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪\nComment: i'm a fisherman i needs,  system chemicaly or machanicanily  to catch otter private  them from my net, please    helps  if you have any idea on that."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

And home to the Saltwater Crocodile. Abundant cattle and birdlife can be seen along its shores. And this provides an excellent food source for the Saltwater Crocodile. Crocodiles in this area are some of the largest seen anywhere in the world. With an estimated 20 crocodiles per kilometre of river, this truly is the land of the giants. Fights break out often in the crocodile world, usually for the best spot. Here it is in slow motion. Watch for the snap. Bam! Of course I went there to see the giant crocodiles. Here is a normal sized croc. And here is Maximus. Estimated to be between 6 and 7 metres in length. As you can imagine, he is very good at intimidating his rivals. He is rarely seen on the bank, probably because of his massive size. This area of the Ord River is adjacent to many cattle properties. Seen here is a helicopter doing a survey, possibly checking how many of their cattle are still alive. Often crocodiles are seen grouped together. Here you can see four crocodiles hanging around in the one spot. Recently a local cattle station reported that they lose one to two cows per day to crocodile attacks. And with the sheer numbers of crocodiles I have seen in this area, I have no doubt. This has been Jeremy Rook, crocstalker.com. Thanks for watching. Please subscribe to my channel.

Even a small wild cat can inflict serious injury.In this episode we look at a lesser cat called the Caracal. Their name is taken from a Turkish word that means \"black ear.\" The Caracal is known best for its large black ears that it uses for its great hunting ability.The Caracal roams the grasslands and open plains from Africa through the Middle East. While its numbers are holding in Africa, we see populations becoming extinct in India due to farming and the unrestricted manufacturing of charcoal from the wild weeds, especially in the Banni grasslands. By supporting animal conservation in these areas we can help save the land for the Caracals and other wildlife. Captive Caracals in the US suffer from people trying to keep them as pets, as well as trying to crossbreed them with domestic cats for the pet trade.For more info about BIG CAT RESCUE visit:  us on FACEBOOK:     YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, so today's species spotlight is on the caracal, which most people say, what is a caracal? Well, we're going to show you one and talk a little bit about them. That is Crackle, and she is a caracal. Caracals are sometimes called desert lynx, but in all reality, they are more closely related to your domestic cat at home than to any of the lynx, being either Siberian lynx or Canadian lynx. One of the characteristics that make them very unique is the fact that they have a pretty plain solid coat. There are only a few other cats that have that sort of coat without markings, and that would be cougars and lions, and strangely enough, they are about the same color as the caracals. The caracals have jet black ears, the back of their ears are black, and they have long tufts, just like the lynx, so that's probably why a lot of people associated them with the lynx or thought they were related. So caracals are found throughout Africa, and they're actually found through the Middle East and parts of Asia, and strangely enough, geographically, caracals are found in the same areas that you find cheetahs. Cheetahs and caracals were found in actually the same locations, and one of the things about these two species is they were both trained by humans to hunt animals on behalf of the humans. So the caracals were trained to hunt birds, rabbits, small gazelles, and of course the cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey. Very fascinating that both of these animals were not tamed, but conditioned by humans to hunt animals, and there was actually contests at one time between the caracals to see which one could kill the most birds, the most pigeons in a flock, and the cheetahs, which one could go fastest and bring down the biggest prey. For the most part, the smaller cats, the smaller predators, they eat animals relative to their size, so they would eat smaller birds or mice, but the caracals actually go after much larger prey. So one of the coolest things about the caracals is that they have this uncanny leaping ability, and they can actually catch birds on the wing. They've been recorded in the wild as jumping up to three meters high, which is almost about as high as I am right now. One of the other facts about caracals is they often live in the plains, and a lot of times they're found where the forest meets the plains. This does put them vulnerable to lions, hyenas, leopards, some of the bigger predators, and oftentimes they do fall prey to these larger animals. So they're not always the hunter, a lot of times they become the hunted. So one of the strange things about the caracal is in a lot of their range, especially in Asia and the Middle East, they're considered endangered, because they're very rare. And then on the other hand, in Africa, a lot of times caracals are considered nuisance, and they're just simply killed because they're a threat to livestock. Here at Big Cat Rescue, all of our caracals were former pets. Along with the serval, the caracal is just very popular among cat collectors, and probably one of the biggest misconceptions with the caracals is the fact that they are so cute when they are babies. They are the most adorable little kittens you've ever seen. Most people don't realize they're going to grow up to be this hissy animal that's going to spray on everything and try to bite you all the time. And there's been several attempts to hybridize these animals, some successful, some not successful, with domestic cats to give everyone sort of an exotic cat that's not quite wild. To me, that's a pretty shady thing to do. These are truly wild animals, great hunters out in the wild. They shouldn't be put in cages. They absolutely shouldn't be diluted down with domestic cat DNA. That's not what they were made to be. And here at Big Cat Rescue, of course, our philosophy is these animals belong in the wild, and the only way that we can ever accomplish that is if we preserve enough habitat in the \nComment: Wow thanks so much for uploading this!

The white sticks out, so its chances of being seen by an eagle or a python, a mongoose, a rival predator, are so much greater. The normal coloured cubs, they blend with the forest floor, the leaf litter, the dappled light in the forest, they kind of disappear. The white cub sticks out like a beacon, very very vulnerable, and its colour makes it even more vulnerable. See the white tiger there trying to suckle on the other tiger, instinctive, gets no milk so immediately starts shouting. All three cubs now gone to sleep. Clambering over these rocks has taken it out of them, all their heads going down, little yawns, eyes closing, nice warm rocks, sun dropping now, temperature dropping, and they're all off for a nice little snooze. The number of sounds that I use to communicate with the cubs, I give a little purring sound, this is what a cheetah mother uses with her cubs, see how it calms them down, and then I use the little chuffing sound. See the other cubs are responding to the purr. Today the little cubs, just a month old, have had their first experience of water, and their first swimming experience. Now of all the big cats, tigers love the water the most. They live in areas where there are big monsoon rains, big rivers, and they will swim. In fact, in the Shundabans, they will swim 15 kilometers between the islands hunting for food. Watch how Shine helps Shunda climb out of the water. This is a typical den site that a tigress will use, nice little caves, and in here she can put these little cubs, get them into the crevices, and make it difficult for a rival predator to get inside. Now every few days, she will move those cubs to a new den site. When the scent builds up, the urine, the dung inside the den, it becomes smelly, and she takes the cub and moves it to a den site that she's found somewhere nearby.\nComment: They should be with their mother"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Video Evidence of Taxpayer Dollars Wasted on Everglades Bridging & Water Pollution Killing Wildlife The news stations and public have been misinformed about the water flowing south through the new 81 to 100 million dollar one mile bridge. The fact is that not a drop has been let through as of yet; the water is too polluted according to National Park regulations to run it south through the National Park. The question is if the water is flowed south will it be able to flow through the National Park the majority of the year? Now a 2.6 mile bridge is in sight, and additional 2.9 miles of bridging to proceed it. The problem we see is that the first 1 mile bridge has not yet been tested. The truth to the whole matter is, the Everglades biggest problem lies up north with pollution that should be corrected before spending taxpayers money on a science project that will be a permeant costly disaster if it does not work.We have studied the water flow patterns through the existing culverts for many decades. We have seen how the wildlife has been affected and have analyzed the situation as a whole. The ecosystem and wildlife is disappearing and suffering. Wildlife is becoming smaller in size, becoming weaker, and natural life spans are getting shorter. In 1998 a florida panther was found dead in Everglades Shark River Slough with levels of mercury so high it could kill an adult human.Right now and for the past several months before the 81 to 100 million dollar bridge was even finished water has actually been flowing through the National Park from south to north through the existing culverts; yes, backwards because the water is too polluted. Everyday a test by one of us has been conducted on the bridge to test the direction of the water flow. A hand full of sand is dropped at the opening, but it sinks straight to the bottom. If the flow of water was flowing south the sand would visibly be carried in that direction. Imagine 2.6 miles of water flowing backwards, (yes north) verses the culverts that are in place now. That equals a lot more water traveling north because water pollution regulations do not permit them to flow south through the National Park. Also sending water south would require permission from the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, which owns lands south of Lake Okeechobee and north of Everglades National Park. The Miccosukee Tribe is against the polluted waters being flowed into their land, and they are taking action to preserve their way of life. They would not be able to survive if the water and food is all poisoned. According to Earth Justice the pumps for polluted water on average contribute the equivalent of 60,000 one hundred pound bag of phosphorus to Lake Okeechobee each year.If the bridging is in place unnatural water depths will follow unnatural hydro-periods and water flow patterns. Now all the wildlife's hammocks will be under water, and there will be no dry land. This will result in unhealthy conditions. More water, more water, more water, is not the answer; Clean water, clean water, clean water, is the answer! Because of being in a hurry to build all these bridges that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars are we really going to sacrifice one environment to stop salt water intrusion down south into the bay? Remember there's only one Everglades and its all connected. All these bridges do not save the Everglades, they flood and pollute them more then they already are. We are affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. We have to treat the source of infection instead of covering it up with a bandaid.\nTranscript: Here we are west of the 2.6 mile bridge proposed area at the S333 lock. Water is not flowing into the Tamiami Trail Canal, the lock is closed. Here we are south of that lock. The water is traveling from the west to the east in the canal south of Tamiami Trail. These overflow pipes were located in this area and removed. When water levels would reach the height of the top of the pipe would flow into the pipe. They would act as an overflow and then flow water south into the canal, flowing the water into the National Park. The water now is flowing at a much more rapid rate into the National Park. The problem is it is making a U-turn and finding the path of least resistance due to sawgrass and a southern ridge. It is making a U-turn and flowing north instead of south. The opposite of what it is supposed to do. As the water flows north it travels through these pipes, culverts that flow into the Tamiami Trail Canal. This area is the center of the 2.6 mile proposed bridge. A bridge located here instead of the culverts would flow way more water north, completely drying out the south. You can see the rapid flow rate with three culverts. Imagine a bridge drying out and creating an unnatural drought south of the Tamiami Trail, interrupting the natural process of this part of the Everglades. Wildlife would suffer. Wildlife has already suffered enough due to over 25 years of held water in these areas and too much water and now more water is proposed, over 2 feet more in the canal. As of right now the National Park does not flow water south due to over 10 parts per billion of water pollution regulations. They have not been able to flow water south even through the one mile bridge. Here you can see water rapidly flowing north through these culverts, the area and center of this 2.6 mile bridge. This is not where the bridge should be located. During droughts this area has always flowed water north. Instead of here, the S3334 locks, when opened, create a suction that even increases drastically the water flow north from the south side, drying up the area even faster. Look at the flow going north into the Tamiami Trail Canal. The Everglades does not travel north, should not travel north. Man has interrupted water flows all over the entire Everglades and we are going to do it again with an irreversible situation and billions of taxpayer dollars. This is where the 2.6 mile bridge would be located. The locks at 3333 are closed. The water is traveling south down the L67 Canal making a U-turn and going back north you can see here on the map. The Blue Shanty, the new river, allowing large amounts of water flow north. This is the S3334 lock area. It is also closed. When opened and water flows south, this creates that suction, vacuum, dropping the water sometimes overnight or days, 6 to 8 inches. Unnatural, completely, not allowing the wildlife to adapt. This is not what is supposed to happen with the bridging. The bridging has to be thought about. The 1 mile bridge has not flowed a drop of water south ever since finished. The public has completely been misinformed. Taxpayer dollars are not at work. The 100 million dollar bridge has not worked. We have stopped and checked this area 3 to 4 times a week with a simple test. Water is not flowing in any direction and has not. When the lock is opened at the S333, it will flow south but sawgrass will clog the area restricting lots of flow. And again, taxpayer dollars will not be well spent. And right now, we must at least test the 1 mile bridge before creating more bad decisions. Another 2.6 mile bridge and maybe even more bridging. Bridge is not working right now. It has not for many, many months. The only way to make this water flow south is to create an unnatural level in the canal which will flow and flood the area, being detrimental and terrible for wildlife, especially mammal life. Heavy pollution coming from the north will kill aquatic life, affecting the food chain. This is not the Everglades restoration. This is the Everglades destruction.\nComment: Update: USGS measured the water flow in the area of the proposed 2.6 mile bridge the other day. Their findings were that their is indeed a negative flow meaning the water is flowing back north through about 9 culverts in the area."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

She was hit by a car a few weeks back, and if you wonder why I'm kind of talking low, well right behind me, a few acres back, that's our rehab area, and that's where Bellina and any other rehab bobcats we might get live before they're released, and she's going to go there. It's a very naturalistic enclosure. There's lots of places for her to hide. We have her, her enclosure's a little bit set up for handicapped animals, did just have all that surgery on her leg, so it enables her to get around. So even though Bellina looks a little bit freaked out right now, she's running up and down the side of the closure. That's actually a good sign for us. It means she doesn't want to be caged up. She wants to get out of captivity, and the good thing about our rehab area, it's a very quiet area. It's nice and isolated, so she's going to be able to peacefully recover from her surgery back there. She'll sort of relearn how to hunt with her repaired leg, and really, even though she's stressed out right now, or she seems stressed out, she's going to have a good, quiet recovery, and there's no way she's going to get accustomed to people. So in the rehab bobcat cage, we have a way to feed them remotely, so we can put the prey animals, which are usually live rats, we can put them in these tubes, and the tubes have several different splits, and they can end up popping up in any area of the cage, and we have this enclosure completely covered with old trees, logs, brush, a lot of places for the prey animal to hide, as well as for the bobcat to hide, so they really have to fine-tune their senses, watch out for these prey animals, and really, it gets them ready for release back into the wild. She's still being fed dead prey right now, but in a couple weeks, we'll be able to feed live prey through the tubes, so she'll be able to relearn how to hunt, relearn how to use that repaired leg. You might wonder how we are aware of the progress of our rehab bobcats, and actually, what we do is we have several remote cameras back there, so we can watch the rehab enclosure from all angles, and we never have people around the enclosure. This really gives us a great idea of how well the animal is hunting, if it's hunting, and really, how ready it is for release. It's pretty amazing, and we're keeping our fingers crossed that real soon, come spring, when there's lots of prey animals out there, she'll be healthy and healed, and we can release her back like we have the previous ones.

These dogs like to run these guts, these ravines and so Andy and I made our way out there and we started making ourselves a little blind, took some old logs, stacking them up. I go to put the mojo out and I come back, Andy's glassed in the field, he says stop what you're doing, I think I see a coyote. Sure enough, we look out, there's two little earsy spots and I just sit down and enough time for this dog to stand up, we lay on the calls and this dog comes sprinting in. Alright, ready? I'm ready.

This footage was shot at beautiful Animal Kingdom (Disney) in Orlando, Fl.\nTranscript: The large flying fox is one of the biggest bats in the world. Even though it may weigh, on average, only two pounds, its wingspan can get to around six feet wide. That is one of the reasons this bat belongs to the suborder, megabat. Or as I say, the suborder, MEGABAT! These large bats are just one of many species of flying fox. They get their name due to their heads, which up close, sort of look like a fox with their pointed ears. These large flying fox come from the islands of Southeast Asia. They will roost high up in the trees and they will become active at sunrise and at sunset. So they aren't strictly nocturnal. And since they're considered an old world bat, they also can't echolocate like some other bats can. So they rely on their sense of smell and strong eyesight to locate food. Food for these large bats is pollen, leaves, flowers, and fruits. So you don't have to worry, they're not going to suck your blood. They play an important role where they can take fruit seeds from one island to another to help the fruits grow in new locations. Now unfortunately, they are often seen as pests since they eat flowers and they then are over hunted. These large flying foxes also need a lot of trees and in Southeast Asia, a lot of forests and jungles are being cut down due to the growing human population and a need for more space. The flying fox will usually give birth to just one pup so it's very important to conserve each and every large bat we see. Their young will stay with them for around 12 to 14 weeks and then they become mature enough to go out on their own. For more information on the flying fox, please read this video's description below. And as always, thanks for watching!\nComment: Pretty cool!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

In this highlight, Forsberg describes his mission to catch a bobcat with a camera trap in Nebraska.-----A nature photographer and Nebraska native, Michael Forsberg shares his work documenting this vast landscape, its lakes, prairies along with its plants and animals.The Great Plains are a dynamic but often forgotten landscape -- overlooked, undervalued, misunderstood, and in desperate need of conservation. Forsberg's book helps lead the way forward, informing and inspiring readers to recognize the wild spirit and splendor of this irreplaceable part of the planet. - California Academy of SciencesMichael Forsberg is a Nebraska native and has focused much of his work in North America's Great Plains, once one of the greatest grassland ecosystems on Earth. His goal has been to try to capture the wild spirit that still survives in these wide-open spaces and put a face to the often overlooked native creatures and landscapes found there. His hope is that the images can build appreciation and go to work to inspire conservation efforts on the land far into the future.Forsberg received a degree in geography with an emphasis in environmental studies from the University of Nebraska, and worked briefly as a seasonal ranger in the National Park Service before accepting a job as a staff photographer and writer producing natural history stories for NEBRASKAland Magazine, the state's conservation publication. He worked at the magazine for six years before starting his own photography business and gallery.Forsberg's work has appeared in publications including Audubon, National Geographic, National Wildlife, and Natural History, and recognized in the Pictures of the Year and Wildlife Photographer of the Year competitions. In 2001, his image of a Nebraska tallgrass prairie was selected for an International Postage Stamp. In 2004, he was awarded a Conservation Education Award from The Wildlife Society. Recently, he was featured in the PBS documentary \"Crane Song,\" and was the 2009 recipient of the North American Nature Photographer's Association Mission Award.\nTranscript: For a TV, the world is thinking. For these four years, I tried to photograph predators like wolves, grizzly bears, mountain lions, bison, all these creatures that still just barely exist in certain areas of their range. And we were successful on all those except for a bobcat. So when the field work was all done, I went back home and we had about three or four months to get the book out the door. And somebody called me from a little prairie outside of my hometown in Lincoln, Nebraska and said, we think we've seen a bobcat. You can try to photograph your bobcat here. So what the heck? So I went out and I put this camera trap up along this game trail. Here's the camera in a waterproof housing. Right here is a transmitter and a receiver where an infrared beam is going across this game trail. And here's a little flash. And here's a little flash right here. So if something walks down here and steps over that log, in theory the camera should take a picture, right? For the first two months, this is what I got. Nothing. I don't know if it was the prairie fairies or if it was my friends playing tricks on me or what, but we didn't get any pictures of anything other than just nothing. And then, finally, after the turn of the year, we started to get photographs. Raccoon first. Bunny rabbit. Farmer Jones cat down the road. Farmer Jones dog down the road. Good job, California. I got a call in early March 2009 from my publisher, and they said, Mike, you got to pull the plug. Book's got to go off to print. You're done. I went out to pick up the camera traps. I had two pictures in the last deal. Here's the first one. And then an hour later, and it was really great to end with that photograph because that's the last picture that was made for this book. And it sort of creates the arc in the story for me because the look in that bobcat's eye is that same look that I saw in that burrowing owl's eye maybe 10 years earlier. The other thing was was that after traveling and being gone away from my family for all that time, I took this photograph 15 minutes from my home in a prairie that's been restored.\nComment: This is not Chris Hansen"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Winter Squirrel Hunting Winter squirrel hunting is a challenging and underutilized sport in Kansas. Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five. I'm Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism.\nComment: Good vid thanks for posting! And for you learning hunters... take 2-3 quiet steps in the woods then stop, look, listen. Then repeat. Slow n steady does the trick! I have a freezer full! Hunting has been real good here in Oklahoma! Now I have been training squirrel dogs known as Original Mt. Curs.

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets.

She was found chained to a wall in a drug house during a law enforcement raid in Tennessee. Because she'd been confined to live on a concrete floor, she had huge swollen masses on her elbows that took months to heal, and was severely underweight. As you can see, she's made a full recovery since being rescued and is now the largest lion we have at the sanctuary, even bigger than our male lions Joseph and Cameron. Because she's such a big girl who just loves to frolic, run around and play, we wanted to provide Nikita with a large addition to her enclosure that she'd be able to explore and enjoy. Big Cat Rescue is situated on 55 acres in Tampa, Florida, and we're home to over 100 rescued exotic cats that were previously unwanted, abandoned or abused. The sanctuary seeks to provide the very best home we can for the cats in our care, and educate the public about the plight of these magnificent animals. The cats' enclosures are created to provide as natural an environment as possible, including trees for our leopards, who love to climb, pools for the tigers, so they can cool off, and even fresh sand for our sand cats to enjoy. So with Nikita in mind, and our goal set in place, we put our Big Cat plan into action. We wanted Nikita's new habitat to include an additional 3,500 square feet. So we needed to build an enclosure addition that measured 50 feet by 70 feet in size, at a cost of approximately $20,000. We put the word out to our supporters, and they definitely roared into action. Big Cat Rescue is fortunate to have supporters around the world who not only enable us to provide for the well-being of the cats, but also that of the sanctuary's fiscal sustainability. Lawrence and Pamela Tristle are two long-time supporters who generously donated half the cost to build Nikita's enclosure expansion as a matching grant, and hundreds of other supporters responded to help meet our goal. The first thing we had to do was make room for the addition, which meant lots of trimming, weeding, root removal, and leveling of the ground. Thanks to volunteers from the U.S. Army Citrus Park Recruiting Station here in Tampa, and of course, Big Cat Rescue volunteers, this was accomplished in record time, while Nikita kept busy watching over all involved. The perimeter of Nikita's new addition was marked out, and construction began. The walls of the enclosure were to be 15 feet in height, with a 5-foot cantilever, making the total height of the enclosure approximately 18 feet. Once all of the posts were in place, over 50 panels were hung, reinforced, cut to size, and then fixed in place. This process took almost three weeks to complete, and I'm sure Nikita was feeling a little sympathetic towards the workers. Then, the big day arrived. The Big Cat transformation was complete. Donors, volunteers, interns, and staff members alike all turned out to see Nikita take her first steps in her new territory. Everything was in place, including Nikita's favorite big yellow boomer ball, as well as a paper mache warthog for her to make friends with. Nikita was definitely ready to explore, while everybody eagerly looked on, and she didn't disappoint. Take a look. Big Cat Rescue would like to thank everyone who made this possible. Nikita may show her appreciation in unique ways, but thanks to our supporters, donors, and volunteers, we've truly enriched the life of this big girl.\nComment: Thank you for your question.

On 08.03.08, this storm hit the US midsection during a year which already had bad storms. The storm is shown in another video, Great Blizzard 2008, Record Breaking, Storm of Century,  video was made one day afterwards. The wildlife were getting hungry. Here two doe and two fawns come up to the bird feeder (they generally inspect it after dark). Although they were very hungry, they were even more curious about the cat. Deer do not appear to understand what domestic animals are and are exceedingly curious.The cat was curious also. The deer kept their distance, but spent some time looking over the cat. One fawn seemed to not be in the best of a mood. It hit its mother with a hoof at least twice (at ~ .46 and 1.2).The deer kept getting closer to the cat by hiding behind the snow drift, then going back to the tree. The snow was so deep that the deer could hardly run through it, when they left.The previous Video begins with view of field and trees taken immediately (~1-2 days) before the storm. Wildlife includes whitetail deer (which are loosing their antlers), wild turkeys, turkey vultures (sighted here for first time of year), and crows. Video then shows blizzard beginning at night. Nighttime animals out included raccoons (only 1 was photographed) and a coyote. These animals were videotaped in infrared. The  storm was getting bad during the coyote filming. Video then shows view of the storm. Only the closest trees were visible during the whiteout, as compared to the normal view of the area. Small snow whirlwinds, tornados, and gusts traveled across the landscape. Snow was cleared here with backhoe.The record breaking snow fall was 20.4 inches. The previous mark in Ohio for snow during 1 storm was 15.3 inches. And this record was made in 1910. Blizzard was compared to the famous blizzard of 1978. Streets were closed, a snow emergency was declared, and plane travel stopped (although I heard a jet while I was filming the coyote). A level 3 snow emergency was declared in many counties. Freeways were closed. Cities had parking bans. Contingents of several snow plows pulled through, some slid off the road. Many accidents occurred. People intending to vacation in warm places were stuck in Ohio.After the storm traffic was still stopped. The streets were used for sledding and snowboarding.Additional views of wild deer on the farm include:LARGE BUCK FIGHT-LOCK ANTLERS, ENTANGLED, CLOSE WHITETAIL  Non-Typical Moose-Sized Buck DEER - ACTION SHOTS RARE WHITE WILD WHITETAIL BUCK  views of this white deer: white deer on the farm -- the banded one & sibling: white deer being stalked by coyotes: strange deer on the farm deer fighting bucks run and jump bucks fighting COYOTES VS.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: @rednogo Thanks for helping spread the word :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Thanks for watching! :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back.

This is Wendy the Guide Girl, also known as Hawk Hunter Diva if you're watching YouTube. I'm sitting in my own back pasture instead of down at the leaves, shopping for some venison. I haven't seen anything I wanted to fling an arrow at yet. I'm in the antler hunting mode. So I got some new stuff from Buzzy. It's called Bowhunter Setup Scrape Juice. So I'm going to test that out today and see if I can't bring in something new. I see something just jumped the fence and I haven't seen it before. So let's check it out and see if he's a shooter. Well, good evening. Welcome to Butch and Wendy's Hunting Adventures. Hawk Hunter Diva decided to go try to get some venison. So we're here in the Hill Country, Texas. The deer are a little smaller up here compared to South Texas or up north, but we have a whole lot of them. I've been sitting in a pop-up blind watching a stream of does and little bucks and stuff. And I was actually after this eight point buck. He was nice and mature, but he didn't come in this morning. And while I was sitting there, this little ten point came in. Well, for the Hill Country, he's a nice little deer. And I decided to go ahead and take him. I had a good hunt. It was nice. And another deal was, the wind wasn't quite blowing right. It's kind of switching around because we have a front coming in. Right now it's 76 degrees here in Central Texas, but tomorrow it's going to be 35 degrees. So actually I was even hunting in shorts this evening. But anyway, the wind was swirling. The deer kept coming in. They were a little spooky. So I'll tell you what I did. I got this Muzzy's Bowhunter set up, the scrape juice, and I sprayed a little bit out the window. And he came in shortly afterwards, but I'll tell you what, don't spray it inside the blind. It smells pretty rough, but I bet deer really like it because I had never seen this buck before out of all the deer I've been watching for the past couple of weeks. And it brought him in, so I guess it works. But have a good evening. Muzzy Phantom did the job, shot him with a crossbow. Central Hill Country of Texas, and it's October 27th, 2010. Y'all have a good evening. We're going to try to go get some more venison here this season, but I guess I'm going to have to change clothes and get something warm. See y'all next time.

Also in my opinion, the ex orphan mothers who were about to give birth traveled purposely back to their keeper's place, to their home unfortunately on their way,  they could not hold it any more and gave birth, that is the explanation why when they finally came at their home, their baby was just 1 day or a few days old. They were not far away. Of course when giving birth, they preferred that their newly born calves were safe from predators so home territory is the ideal place, surrounded by their keepers ( human family ) and other elephants.  Ex orphans learned that they could count on their human family..so they keep on coming back, visiting, introducing their kids, asking for help etc..

Sure, it was the number one dishwashing brand, the biggest advertiser in the category, and sported some of the highest equity ratings of all consumer goods in the country. So what's the problem, you ask? What we haven't mentioned yet is that we're the most expensive brand. Consumers spend an average of 18 seconds at shelf and tend to make rational decisions based on price. So Dawn had to turn to something it has, something our competition will never have, a commitment to saving wildlife cotton oil spills. The best part about it is the fact that it isn't some invented marketing ploy. It's the one and only cleaner wildlife experts have been using to clean animals' cotton oil spills for more than 30 years. Why? Because Dawn is tough enough to cut through grease, even natural disaster-type grease, while being gentle enough to clean the delicate skins of these animals, as you can see in our national TV commercial. Wildlife rescue workers open up a lot of Dawn, tough on grease, yet gentle. Dawn helps open something even bigger. This year, Dawn is also donating $1 million. Learn more at Dawn Saves Wildlife. The centerpiece of our effort was a nine-part documentary series, The Big Picture, shown only online. The series showed the everyday threats to wildlife and explained what people could do about it. The Big Picture could be seen on dawnsaveswildlife.com and YouTube. Pelicans are one of California's big success stories. They just came off the endangered species list in 2009. They're thriving despite all of these issues that they're still having to deal with. Pelicans are prehistoric creatures. This is an animal that's evolved over time and is specific for plunge-feeding fish. When people feed them, they stop doing what they do naturally and start looking in the dumpsters. What happens with that is they become dirty. The biggest problem that it causes is it contaminates their feathers. And that ability to be waterproof, it can make them hypothetical. At the end of the day, they have to be cleaned. We have the product that does it, and it works better than anything. Dawn. Paid media drove people to the micro-site. The micro-site encouraged consumers to share with their friends on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. We use social media to update our fans on the program, sharing each new episode, and sharing the results of the micro-site. The micro-site is a place where you can share with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. It's a new episode and enabling consumers to show their support for the cause. When our consumer got to the store, she was drawn to images of wildlife on shelf displays, end aisle caps, and, of course, on the limited-edition bottle labels themselves. The campaign was picked up by news channels like CNN, Good Morning America, Huffington Post, and People magazine. Rob Lowe made special appearances talking about his support of the program and his role as narrator.

And home to the Saltwater Crocodile. Abundant cattle and birdlife can be seen along its shores. And this provides an excellent food source for the Saltwater Crocodile. Crocodiles in this area are some of the largest seen anywhere in the world. With an estimated 20 crocodiles per kilometre of river, this truly is the land of the giants. Fights break out often in the crocodile world, usually for the best spot. Here it is in slow motion. Watch for the snap. Bam! Of course I went there to see the giant crocodiles. Here is a normal sized croc. And here is Maximus. Estimated to be between 6 and 7 metres in length. As you can imagine, he is very good at intimidating his rivals. He is rarely seen on the bank, probably because of his massive size. This area of the Ord River is adjacent to many cattle properties. Seen here is a helicopter doing a survey, possibly checking how many of their cattle are still alive. Often crocodiles are seen grouped together. Here you can see four crocodiles hanging around in the one spot. Recently a local cattle station reported that they lose one to two cows per day to crocodile attacks. And with the sheer numbers of crocodiles I have seen in this area, I have no doubt. This has been Jeremy Rook, crocstalker.com. Thanks for watching. Please subscribe to my channel.

I also interacted with the fauna of the ecosystem, including snappers, bluegills, and cormorants, who were busy hunting fish. This experience stands out as one of my favorite wildlife encounters to date. The manatees are so friendly, and genuinely seem to appreciate your company. They eagerly seek out belly-rubs and scratches in the same way my dog does. It was so much fun hanging out with them. Unfortunately, I also saw scars on the backs of nearly every manatee in the springs. The animals get hurt or killed from run-ins with boats in the Florida waterways. Only 5,000 or so of these amazing animals remain in the wild. This was filmed with GoPro Hero2 and Hero3 cameras, filmed at either 1080p or 2.7k, 30fps, using the ProTune setting.

For more information go to \nTranscript: This is a barn owl. Wow, it's such a beautiful bird. Look at some of its amazing adaptations. It's got this incredible heart-shaped face. Now the facial disc actually gathers sound in the same way as your ears do. The ears are actually just behind the eyes within the feathers, which are really hard to see. And when it's hunting, it can actually hear the sounds of small mammals on the ground below, which is incredible. Its flight is very, very quiet, partly because the feathers are so soft and the body is so light, it passes through the air really, really gently. The legs are really, really long, which is an adaptation for diving into long grass and catching the small mammals which they feed on. The eyesight is amazing as well. Barn owls are able to detect movement when there's hardly any light. It's just such an incredible bird. But unfortunately, there are some problems with the barn owl because of these specialisations. Adapted for hunting from the air, it has to be very light. Barn owls can't put on a lot of fat to help them get through the winter. And also, its feathers, which are so soft and not particularly waterproof, so a barn owl can't hunt during the rain. And so the weather has an effect, food shortage has an effect, and numbers of barn owls go up and down tremendously in response to these environmental changes. It's a sad fact that barn owls have declined tremendously, particularly since World War II. The landscape upon which we all depend has changed tremendously. And barn owls have declined because of a reduction in food supply, because of intensive agriculture, loss of hedgerows, loss of old pasture, loss of the rough grassland with all those small mammals in it. Unfortunately, they're prone to accidental deaths. They die from flying into things like motor vehicles on motorways. And a lot of barn owls starve to death because of a lack of food. So the numbers have gone down by at least 70% since the 1930s, which is something we're really trying to address. Because of their rarity, barn owls are afforded special legal protection. They're not only protected against being killed, as are most wild birds, but they're also protected against disturbance whilst they're nesting. Barn owls are also known as an indicator species. If there are barn owls, plenty of them, in the environment, then that's an indication that actually the food chain is really healthy. There's lots of nice, rough habitat supporting lots of small mammals, supporting barn owls. And if you have that habitat, of course, there's so much other biodiversity which will be supported by it.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: What an amazing comment.

The sanctuary is a permanent home to over 100 rescued big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards. As well as smaller species like bobcats, servals, and sand cats. Campers arrive every day and get to explore our 55 acre property, making sure they say hello to the cats and taking lots of photos along the way. While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this. We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life. Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans. They get to do lots of fun activities, like making Big Cat popsicles and learning about our operant conditioning program and why it's so important to the cats at the sanctuary. Then campers observe Big Cat keepers handing out the popsicles they made and the cats willingly participating in our operant conditioning program.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Our Primate Cousins Photo slideshow of various primates I've worked with at a wild animal park (except the orangutans and gorillas, which were photographed elsewhere). Humans belong to the taxonomic Order Primates, which is comprised of 11 Families, 52 Genera, & 181 species. Primates are divided into two main groups: Prosimians (literally \"before monkeys/apes) and Anthropoids (literally \"man like\"). The evolution of primates is characterized by trends toward mobile limbs, grasping hands, a flattened face, binocular vision, a large, complex brain, & a reduced reproductive rate. Most Primates are well adapted to arboreal living (living in trees).Primate evolution occurred primarily during the Cenozoic Era, Prosimians first branching off in the early Eocene Epoch 58 mya (million years ago).Around 33 mya, during the Oligocene Epoch, the Anthropoids split off into 3 main groups: New World Monkeys (w/prehensile tails), Old World Monkeys (w/out prehensile tails), & the Hominoids (eventual Apes & Humans w/out any tails).In the Miocene Epoch, around 15 mya, Asian Apes & African Apes diverged paths. At approx. 6 mya, African Apes & Human lineage split, producing Hominids (members of the taxonomic Human Family Hominidae) in a region of Central Africa called the Great Rift Valley. There, dense jungle gave way to great savannah plains, & bipedalism became a helpful adaptation in surviving in a high grass environment w/a variety of predators. To this day, Chimpanzees & Humans share 98.5% of the same DNA sequences, even though millions of years separate us from a common ancestor. The evidence for evolution has been found within the fossil record. Additional corroboration has been found comparing DNA sequences which show dramatic linkages between all modern primate species. A comparative study of mitochondrial DNA shows that the differences among present human populations are consistent w/their having a common ancestor no more than a million years ago.Prosimian (lemurs, tarsiers, bushbabies & lorises)0:26-0:45 Ring Tailed LemurAnthropoids (monkeys, apes & humans)  New World Monkeys (w/prehensile tails)0:52-1:02 Black Tamarin Marmoset1:03-1:10 Squirrel Monkey1:11-1:18 Capuchin Monkey1:19-1:26 Woolly Monkey1:27-2:10 Spider Monkey **1:47-1:51 a spider monkey is investigating/ harassing a river turtle.**1:52-1:57 two spider monkeys are investigating/ harassing an alligator.Old World Monkeys (w/out prehensile tails)2:13-2:36 Vervet Monkey aka Green Monkey or Guenon or Grivet **These are the monkeys scientists have thus far linked as a carrier species for the RNA retrovirus associated w/HIV/AIDS.2:37-3:43 Rhesus Macaque**3:13-3:43 show a troop of rhesus macaques interacting w/Sika & Fallow deer, as well as Mouflon sheep & raccoons.Hominoids (apes & humans, w/out any tail) Asian Apes3:45-3:53 White Handed Gibbon3:54-4:08 OrangutanAfrican Apes4:11-4:32 Lowland Gorilla4:33-4:59 ChimpanzeeHuman4:52-4:59 Me kissing a Chimpanzee ^_^All photographs are the property of Dafttool & cannot be reproduced or used without the expressed authorization of Dafttool.\nTranscript: You You You You We Hey Everyone can see we're together All of the people around us they say Can they be that close?

Tiger just wants some rubs. Look how affectionate this baby is. Oh my goodness. And this is Nora, the Bengal tiger. Now, Bengal tigers get this way due to a lack of red and yellow pigments. Hello! And also, inbreeding promotes recessive traits, and having the lack of the orange is a recessive trait. And sadly, a lot of inbreeding is done just to, you know, continue this species. But they're gorgeous. All of these rescued wildcats are getting a new lease on life, thanks to the Wildcat Haven Sanctuary. The Wildcat Haven Sanctuary receives no state or federal funding, and they rely on funds from sponsors and donors like us. Please, do something. www.wildcathaven.org Click me now!

This is Wendy the Guide Girl, also known as Hawk Hunter Diva if you're watching YouTube. I'm sitting in my own back pasture instead of down at the leaves, shopping for some venison. I haven't seen anything I wanted to fling an arrow at yet. I'm in the antler hunting mode. So I got some new stuff from Buzzy. It's called Bowhunter Setup Scrape Juice. So I'm going to test that out today and see if I can't bring in something new. I see something just jumped the fence and I haven't seen it before. So let's check it out and see if he's a shooter. Well, good evening. Welcome to Butch and Wendy's Hunting Adventures. Hawk Hunter Diva decided to go try to get some venison. So we're here in the Hill Country, Texas. The deer are a little smaller up here compared to South Texas or up north, but we have a whole lot of them. I've been sitting in a pop-up blind watching a stream of does and little bucks and stuff. And I was actually after this eight point buck. He was nice and mature, but he didn't come in this morning. And while I was sitting there, this little ten point came in. Well, for the Hill Country, he's a nice little deer. And I decided to go ahead and take him. I had a good hunt. It was nice. And another deal was, the wind wasn't quite blowing right. It's kind of switching around because we have a front coming in. Right now it's 76 degrees here in Central Texas, but tomorrow it's going to be 35 degrees. So actually I was even hunting in shorts this evening. But anyway, the wind was swirling. The deer kept coming in. They were a little spooky. So I'll tell you what I did. I got this Muzzy's Bowhunter set up, the scrape juice, and I sprayed a little bit out the window. And he came in shortly afterwards, but I'll tell you what, don't spray it inside the blind. It smells pretty rough, but I bet deer really like it because I had never seen this buck before out of all the deer I've been watching for the past couple of weeks. And it brought him in, so I guess it works. But have a good evening. Muzzy Phantom did the job, shot him with a crossbow. Central Hill Country of Texas, and it's October 27th, 2010. Y'all have a good evening. We're going to try to go get some more venison here this season, but I guess I'm going to have to change clothes and get something warm. See y'all next time. Later.\nComment: That's to cool, nice buck to congrats"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The Nature Conservancy is working with partners to buy critical lands, bringing hope for the future of these majestic animals.\nTranscript: Today, thanks to the efforts of organizations like the Nature Conservancy, the number of Florida panthers that roam the South Florida landscape is growing. About 160 panthers are thought to exist today, up from only 30 in 1995. Will this momentum continue? Can these iconic animals and our communities thrive together? Yes, but we all must play a role in realizing this vision. The tiny piece of our planet Florida panthers call home is simply too small. Cities and other barriers make it almost impossible for panthers to roam and grow. The panther has been tenacious and while their population levels have dropped over time, we've seen them rebound with science and conservation coming together. But they're now at a critical point. They've reached carrying capacity. That's the amount of population they can have in the area they currently live. In 2012, the Nature Conservancy purchased the narrow passage where panthers are crossing the Caloosahatchee River. Protecting this passage gives panthers access to healthy habitat to grow and raise their young. But that habitat could go away if we don't act now. They need more land, and the great thing is that land's available. This area of Florida matters to all of us. These natural and agricultural areas clean our water and air, and the recreation and economic opportunities they present are primary reasons why so many people live in and visit our great state. We have the chance to secure a healthy future for the land, for us, for the panther. What if we miss this opportunity? You can be a part of making sure the number of panthers in the wild can head in the right direction, meaning that this area continues to support not only their growth, but ours too. Today, 160. \nComment: These beautiful wild animals must be protected and safeguarded. . . This is their land too.  These are iconic majestic animals that should thrive in the wild. People need to respect them and their spaces."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: I expected to be disgusted by a large rat, but Mandy wasn't grotesque at all & I'm actually quite impressed."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back.

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: @Cheerio753 Buffalo NY?

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

The fact is that not a drop has been let through as of yet; the water is too polluted according to National Park regulations to run it south through the National Park. The question is if the water is flowed south will it be able to flow through the National Park the majority of the year? Now a 2.6 mile bridge is in sight, and additional 2.9 miles of bridging to proceed it. The problem we see is that the first 1 mile bridge has not yet been tested. The truth to the whole matter is, the Everglades biggest problem lies up north with pollution that should be corrected before spending taxpayers money on a science project that will be a permeant costly disaster if it does not work.We have studied the water flow patterns through the existing culverts for many decades. We have seen how the wildlife has been affected and have analyzed the situation as a whole. The ecosystem and wildlife is disappearing and suffering. Wildlife is becoming smaller in size, becoming weaker, and natural life spans are getting shorter. In 1998 a florida panther was found dead in Everglades Shark River Slough with levels of mercury so high it could kill an adult human.Right now and for the past several months before the 81 to 100 million dollar bridge was even finished water has actually been flowing through the National Park from south to north through the existing culverts; yes, backwards because the water is too polluted. Everyday a test by one of us has been conducted on the bridge to test the direction of the water flow. A hand full of sand is dropped at the opening, but it sinks straight to the bottom. If the flow of water was flowing south the sand would visibly be carried in that direction. Imagine 2.6 miles of water flowing backwards, (yes north) verses the culverts that are in place now. That equals a lot more water traveling north because water pollution regulations do not permit them to flow south through the National Park. Also sending water south would require permission from the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, which owns lands south of Lake Okeechobee and north of Everglades National Park. The Miccosukee Tribe is against the polluted waters being flowed into their land, and they are taking action to preserve their way of life. They would not be able to survive if the water and food is all poisoned. According to Earth Justice the pumps for polluted water on average contribute the equivalent of 60,000 one hundred pound bag of phosphorus to Lake Okeechobee each year.If the bridging is in place unnatural water depths will follow unnatural hydro-periods and water flow patterns. Now all the wildlife's hammocks will be under water, and there will be no dry land. This will result in unhealthy conditions. More water, more water, more water, is not the answer; Clean water, clean water, clean water, is the answer! Because of being in a hurry to build all these bridges that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars are we really going to sacrifice one environment to stop salt water intrusion down south into the bay? Remember there's only one Everglades and its all connected. All these bridges do not save the Everglades, they flood and pollute them more then they already are. We are affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. We have to treat the source of infection instead of covering it up with a bandaid.\nTranscript: Here we are west of the 2.6 mile bridge proposed area at the S333 lock. Water is not flowing into the Tamiami Trail Canal, the lock is closed. Here we are south of that lock. The water is traveling from the west to the east in the canal south of Tamiami Trail. These overflow pipes were located in this area and removed. When water levels would reach the height of the top of the pipe would flow into the pipe. They would act as an overflow and then flow water south into the canal, flowing the water into the National Park. The water now is flowing at a much more rapid rate into the National Park. The problem is it is making a U-turn and finding the path of least resistance due to sawgrass and a southern ridge. It is making a U-turn and flowing north instead of south. The opposite of what it is supposed to do. As the water flows north it travels through these pipes, culverts that flow into the Tamiami Trail Canal. This area is the center of the 2.6 mile proposed bridge. A bridge located here instead of the culverts would flow way more water north, completely drying out the south. You can see the rapid flow rate with three culverts. Imagine a bridge drying out and creating an unnatural drought south of the Tamiami Trail, interrupting the natural process of this part of the Everglades. Wildlife would suffer. Wildlife has already suffered enough due to over 25 years of held water in these areas and too much water and now more water is proposed, over 2 feet more in the canal. As of right now the National Park does not flow water south due to over 10 parts per billion of water pollution regulations. They have not been able to flow water south even through the one mile bridge. Here you can see water rapidly flowing north through these culverts, the area and center of this 2.6 mile bridge. This is not where the bridge should be located. During droughts this area has always flowed water north. Instead of here, the S3334 locks, when opened, create a suction that even increases drastically the water flow north from the south side, drying up the area even faster. Look at the flow going north into the Tamiami Trail Canal. The Everglades does not travel north, should not travel north. Man has interrupted water flows all over the entire Everglades and we are going to do it again with an irreversible situation and billions of taxpayer dollars. This is where the 2.6 mile bridge would be located. The locks at 3333 are closed. The water is traveling south down the L67 Canal making a U-turn and going back north you can see here on the map. The Blue Shanty, the new river, allowing large amounts of water flow north. This is the S3334 lock area. It is also closed. When opened and water flows south, this creates that suction, vacuum, dropping the water sometimes overnight or days, 6 to 8 inches. Unnatural, completely, not allowing the wildlife to adapt. This is not what is supposed to happen with the bridging. The bridging has to be thought about. The 1 mile bridge has not flowed a drop of water south ever since finished. The public has completely been misinformed. Taxpayer dollars are not at work. The 100 million dollar bridge has not worked. We have stopped and checked this area 3 to 4 times a week with a simple test. Water is not flowing in any direction and has not. When the lock is opened at the S333, it will flow south but sawgrass will clog the area restricting lots of flow. And again, taxpayer dollars will not be well spent. And right now, we must at least test the 1 mile bridge before creating more bad decisions. Another 2.6 mile bridge and maybe even more bridging. Bridge is not working right now. It has not for many, many months. The only way to make this water flow south is to create an unnatural level in the canal which will flow and flood the area, being detrimental and terrible for wildlife, especially mammal life. Heavy pollution coming from the north will kill aquatic life, affecting the food chain. This is not the Everglades restoration. This is the Everglades destruction.\nComment: Every time someone contacts the National Park for answers regarding this video they get the same general responses with no real answers.\n\nNational Park response #1) There is some localized northward flow just to the east of S333, because the water level on the west of the L67 extension levee is higher than water level on the east. \n\nNational Park response #2) The hydrology in the area is complicated, but we have been studying it for years and have a good handle on it.\n\nWhat they won't tell you because they can't is how are they going to stop the South side from drying up during times of drought, water pollution, or when lock #334 is opened because they need water? The answer is with a 2.6 mile bridge you won't be able to.\n\nPeople are finally starting to understand and it is very important for all of us to continue to watch & share this video as much as we can as we are the protecters of the Everglades."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: OMG! That is so cute!

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: River Otters vs Alligators 03 Music  Otters are semi-aquatic, slender, long-bodied mammals which are specialized for capturing prey in the water. Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old. River Otters was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro / South Florida 2014.\nTranscript: ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪\nComment: Deepak saraswat"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: do you use iron sights I use them I live in Huntington area"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

These forests are home to diverse fauna and flora, many of them showing affinities to the Malayan region, but are increasingly threatened by human activity. Several national parks and other protected areas lie within the range, but it is estimated that only a small fraction of the Western Ghats remains in pristine condition. The Silent Valley National Park in Kerala is considered by many to be the last tracts of virgin tropical evergreen forest in India.Biogeographers have long recognized the distinctive plant and animal communities of the Western Ghats. Many of these faunal and floral elements are not found anywhere else in India except in parts of northeastern India. The Western Ghats are also home to many endemic species, and the endemism is especially high in the amphibian and reptilian fauna.\nTranscript: so so so so so ah uh so hmm so so so so so so so\nComment: Wow Nice....I love nature........"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna.

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

I go to put the mojo out and I come back, Andy's glassed in the field, he says stop what you're doing, I think I see a coyote. Sure enough, we look out, there's two little earsy spots and I just sit down and enough time for this dog to stand up, we lay on the calls and this dog comes sprinting in. Alright, ready? I'm ready. You ready for this? I'm ready. Ready. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Woo! Woo! Woo! Alright, I'm just going to stick with that saying, you hunt enough, you're going to miss them once in a while. I could go on with a list of how the bipod got in the way, Andy was yelling at me and making me panic. A coyote 8 yards with a scope of five powers, just too much, but I didn't want to start the season like this, but this footage was just phenomenal. The mojo brought him right in, the calls brought him right in, and this whole trip to Colorado was amazing. Unfortunately, I missed the dog, that stuff happens.\nComment: You guys need to practice more .He was standing still for a long time but I guess he was too far for you but that is a chip shot for many varmint hunters...."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Genesis Wildlife Rehabilitation Center This is a short glimpse into what goes on at the Genesis Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, Beech Mountain, North Carolina.\nTranscript: Hi, my name's Leslie. I'm the director of Genesis Wildlife Conservation Center and the Sanctuary. We began in about 1983, and then it grew from there so that we're now a charity. We collect from the people who come here, donors. Some of it we get from foundations. But we rehab about 600 to 700 birds and animals every year. Most of them are released back to the wild, and some of them can be released to their own environment. Music Because he's so small, he wouldn't really stand a chance out in the wild. Are you guys looking for someone to take him in? No, we keep him and use him for education. You have to have permits to have any of the animals. We have to have federal, state, USDA permits, everything. Music I know. That's why we keep them well padded. All the cages are padded, so when they fall, they only fall to the bedding. That's Samsara. Sam I've had since 1998. Music Such beautiful birds. Sasha is now six months old. She came to us as a baby about five weeks old when the whole nest fell to the ground. Her brother did just fine, and he's already been released. But the female, Sasha, on the x-ray, it shows the right wing just really shattered and not able to pin it. So that's why she stays with us. And we take her around to schools, and we talk about their habitat and the need to preserve it. Music This black and white one down here, though, that has an interesting story because see how her wing droops? That's only part of her injuries. I had released her along with a bunch of other pigeons. And then when she came back, she was in the backyard, like in the middle of February, and it was snow everywhere. And I looked out the back window, and it was just blood everywhere. And I ran out to see what it was, and it was this poor little pigeon. And she had come back to get cared, I guess, or at least it was a safe haven for her. So we treated her. She's blind in one eye. She had a lot of, I mean, her whole side was ripped off. The wing was broken. So I treated her back. She fell in love with the old fantail pigeon. And when the old fantail got sick, she would take care of him. I had him inside in a small cage. She would get up under his wing and walk him to the dinner dish. And her story is that when she was about three weeks old, some kids found her in the bushes, probably while her mom was moving them from one place to another. So she spent the next nine weeks at the animal control, where she was placed in a cage next to dogs and cats. And then she was taken to the vet. So she didn't learn to fear any of us. So that's why she's got to stay with us. I tried to release her a couple times, and it was a failure each time. This one over here is Cali, Calahari. And Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. So she's about seven years old, and she's had a pretty bad life before. I got her from animal control in Ashe, and she had been there 11 months, and they were not able to place her with anybody that had a USDA permit. And you have to have a USDA permit to keep these cats. Hey, come on in. She was just spayed. Again, we use these in educational programs to show people that they really are very sweet animals. They're extremely intelligent, very curious animals. ♪♪ People think the only thing they're good for is just for shooting. They're just supposed to be a sport animal, and they're not. Of course, they serve a lot of different purposes, but other than that, they have their own right to live just because they are. God made all of us, and we all have a right to live. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ You can go to our website, which is genesiswildlife.org, and you can get an idea about our volunteer relationships. We have a lot of volunteers here. We have a lot of groups that come. Sometimes we can get 15 or 20 people. And, of course, you put in three hours. That's an incredible amount of work that we can get done in just one day. So it's really nice when we get Cub Scouts or ASU volunteers. As a matter of fact, we had the ETSU come, and they were the ones that built this whole deck behind me. They built the entire thing in one day, but we had about 20 big guys come here to do that. As far as donations, it's just not monetarily, but you can also donate lumber. You can donate time. You can donate equipment. We get a lot of people who just come with their building their homes, and they have a lot of leftover lumber, a lot of things like that. They can come, and we can use all of that lumber. We can use everything. We get people who just bring in linens, which is extremely important to us. Some people will bring in some of the dog food and the sunflower seeds, bags of bird seed. All of these things can be donated to us.

The Coyote Pack is growing. We just hit 50,000 subscribers and it's all because of you. Yes, you, the audience. Keep sharing the videos because the bigger we get, the bigger the adventures get. Stick around, Question of the Week is coming up next. Welcome back. In case you guys missed last week's Behind the Adventure, make sure you check it out. There's still the chance to win those awesome SOG adventure tools. I got some great questions this past week. The one that really stood out came in from Ray Wong. Ray asks, hey Coyote and the crew, I've been wondering how the Coyote Pack is going to grow in the future. How are we going to make it grow in the future? I'm going to tell you how we're going to make it grow. We're going to make it grow in the future. I've been wondering, how long does it take for you guys to produce one of your typical 10 minute episodes? That's a really great question, Ray. And it's tough to answer that one directly because each episode is different. So the crew and I got together and we talked about this and we kind of came upon the number of 48 collective working hours to make one of the 10 minute episodes that you see every single week. And it's different based on animal and location. But there's three different parts that goes into every single episode. Pre-production, production, and post-production. First, let's talk about the pre-production. And it starts with the internet and with field guides. I do a ton of research about the animals that I might want to encounter. And then I start researching the locations that we can travel to to ultimately encounter these animals. Once I figure out what animal it is we want to go after, we start booking our trip and then production begins. Once we actually get on the ground in a location, it can take us days sometimes to find some of these animals. So it's me, it's Mark, it's Chance, it's Melissa, it's my wildlife biologist Mario, and we'll be out there three, four, five days trying to encounter as many animals as we can. So let's say we're in Arizona, we've put together a list of 15 different animals that we want to encounter. We're not gonna see all 15 of these animals. We might see five of those animals and then we might see four or five that we didn't plan on seeing. I've gotta be ready for any situation and any animal at any point in time, which makes it challenging. Once we're there in the environment, and let's say it's a rattlesnake, and we've encountered the rattlesnake and I've caught the rattlesnake, the catch is obviously the most dangerous part. Once I've got the animal in my hands and under control, the camera team can move in close and we begin filming the presentation segment. After we get all of the footage that we needed in the field, then it goes in to post-production. This is a whole different ballgame. This is where you actually put together the puzzle. Now when we come back from a trip, we have anywhere between, I don't know, maybe 40 and 50 hours worth of footage. Think about that, 40 or 50 hours worth of footage that breaks down into these little seven to 10 minute segments. We begin sifting through all of it, finding the best shots, finding the takes that I don't mess up on, and piecing them together. Then comes the sound effects, then comes the music, then comes the color correction, and ultimately, we have a finished episode that we get to upload to YouTube for everyone out there to enjoy. So again, I'd say in total, to put together one of our typical 10 minute episodes, it probably takes about 48 working hours. That was a fantastic question, Ray. Keep writing in every single week. I'll be out here in the field answering your questions. I'm Coyote Peterson. Be brave, stay wild. We'll see you next week. So for me, this is gonna be one heck of an experience. Even though it's a bear that's been raised in captivity for educational purposes, he's an ambassador for his species, it is still a grizzly bear and deserves an incredible amount of respect. I can see it right over my shoulder here and it is big. You're gonna come hiking through this game trail here across this pass. Have a camera down there getting that perspective. Adam will be coming back from that game trail leading to the bushes. There's good cover there, so we can have somebody back there with him. He's gonna come out as you're passing by and he's gonna startle you and you're gonna turn around and you're gonna do what you're supposed to do.\nComment: You need your own Tv show these vids are interesting, keep up the good work"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: And this is the work of the master builder among bower birds. I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: all i know is that life is phenomenologically valid--something is going on.  It seems rather special, and i'm on the search for the most happiness i can contain.  not sure what there really is else to search for"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Thank you for watching and commenting.

The lionesses haven't made a successful kill in days. All three are producing milk. They need to replenish their reserves. Kali splits off from the pride, while mother and Ani hide the cubs. She heads to a narrow island that sits just above the water table. In winter, grass above the water line dries out. It's perfect camouflage for a tawny coat. And dry ground is the lechwe's achilles heel, the long hooves that make them fast in the water slow them down on terra firma. The lioness can clock nearly 40 miles per hour on hard ground, but she can only sprint for 100 yards. She has to close the gap between them before she attacks. Kali's impatient. She closes in too fast. The lechwe uses the head start to bolt for the water. Again, the swamp defeats her.\nComment: @iPriestHolmes the antilope thing (or whatever it is) that the lioness was trying to kill. it's legs make it faster when running in water, but they make it slower on land."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

I can already hear the birds in the background and I hear they've got a few of these babies as well. So I'm excited. Let's go check it out. The Wildlife Sanctuary was built in 1975 to protect rare Arabian species such as the Oryx, Adex and Reem gazelle. Now the park has over 1,000 species of animals including exotic birds, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas and even a few giraffes. Visitors to the park pay about 1 dinar for a tour and overview of the facilities. The tour includes a short video of the wildlife in the area and a bus ride through the reserve. So we're at the carnivorous complex now. Could you tell us about the animals that live here? We have here the Arabian leopard. This Arabian leopard is a very dangerous species and we have also the Arabian wolf. He is endangered and the caracal is a very endangered species and cheetah also. We're going into the cheetah cage right now. I'm just a little bit nervous. Oh, more birds. Don't, don't tease me. Don't tease me. Don't tease me. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. I want to touch it now. Okay, you touch, no problem. It is okay, I know. Oh, look at me, look at me. Look at me. Catering to visitors and residents alike, the Al Horeen Wildlife Park is a must-see experience for the animal enthusiasts. The park is perfect for families and animal lovers to explore at leisure.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: My blood is boiling!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Listen to Master Keeper Barbara Frank talk about Dances and Canadian Lynx in the wild.Image of Canadian Lynx in trap courtesy of:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: This is Dances with Wolves, Big Cat Rescue's resident Canadian lynx. She's also one of the oldest cats at the sanctuary. She'll be turning 19 in July. The name lynx comes from the Greek word to shine, which is probably in reference to the reflective ability of the cat's eyes. The Canadian lynx looks very similar to its cousin, the Siberian lynx. Their dense fur ranges in color from a reddish brown to gray. They have a flared facial ruff, black ear tufts, and long hind legs with a short tail. Their large, widespread feet are covered in fur, which act as snowshoes and are effective in supporting the cat's weight on the snow. They are often confused with their smaller feline cousin, the bobcat, but can be easily distinguished by their tail tips. The tail of the lynx looks as though it was dipped in an inkwell, being black all the way around, whereas the bobcat's tail appears to have been painted black on top and white on the bottom. They are larger on average than the bobcat, yet vary less in size, so the largest bobcats can outsize the lynx. Canadian lynx are found in the northern forests across almost all of Canada and Alaska, as well as in certain parts of North America. They're a secretive and mostly nocturnal animal, although they may be active at any time of the day. Unlike any other species of cat, the lynx depends almost exclusively on the snowshoe hare. No other predator has such a strong cyclic prey base to which it has become uniquely adapted. The snowshoe hare population peaks every 10 years, and with it, so does the lynx population. While lynx will change their prey base when hares are low to include rodents, birds, larger prey such as deer, the overall lynx population is still synchronous with the hare population. The greatest threat to the Canadian lynx is being trapped for their fur, and when this is done during low numbers, it makes recovery of the population extremely difficult. And of course, just like all the other wild species of cats, destruction of their habitat by humans is also a big concern. Dances with Wolves was rescued from a game farm. Game farms are places where exotic animals are bred for photography and filming. These animals are often drugged and chained in place and surrounded by props that resemble their natural habitat. These are many of the photos that you see on calendars and in commercials. To find out more, visit our website, bigcatrescue.org. You can help us change the way people treat big cats by texting the word TIGER to 20222.\nComment: Today, the habitat of the Iberian lynx is protected and the hunting of the wild cats is prohibited.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: Lots of bananas for Mandy!

These forests are home to diverse fauna and flora, many of them showing affinities to the Malayan region, but are increasingly threatened by human activity. Several national parks and other protected areas lie within the range, but it is estimated that only a small fraction of the Western Ghats remains in pristine condition.

And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: Lol porcupine was like ...\" Where the hell did u come from ?\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets. A female red fox is known as a vixen, and a male red fox is known as a dog fox; a fox baby is known as a kit or cub.\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: Your videos are amazing!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Even a small wild cat can inflict serious injury.In this episode we look at a lesser cat called the Caracal. Their name is taken from a Turkish word that means \"black ear.\" The Caracal is known best for its large black ears that it uses for its great hunting ability.The Caracal roams the grasslands and open plains from Africa through the Middle East. While its numbers are holding in Africa, we see populations becoming extinct in India due to farming and the unrestricted manufacturing of charcoal from the wild weeds, especially in the Banni grasslands. By supporting animal conservation in these areas we can help save the land for the Caracals and other wildlife. Captive Caracals in the US suffer from people trying to keep them as pets, as well as trying to crossbreed them with domestic cats for the pet trade.For more info about BIG CAT RESCUE visit:  us on FACEBOOK:     YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, so today's species spotlight is on the caracal, which most people say, what is a caracal? Well, we're going to show you one and talk a little bit about them. That is Crackle, and she is a caracal. Caracals are sometimes called desert lynx, but in all reality, they are more closely related to your domestic cat at home than to any of the lynx, being either Siberian lynx or Canadian lynx. One of the characteristics that make them very unique is the fact that they have a pretty plain solid coat. There are only a few other cats that have that sort of coat without markings, and that would be cougars and lions, and strangely enough, they are about the same color as the caracals. The caracals have jet black ears, the back of their ears are black, and they have long tufts, just like the lynx, so that's probably why a lot of people associated them with the lynx or thought they were related. So caracals are found throughout Africa, and they're actually found through the Middle East and parts of Asia, and strangely enough, geographically, caracals are found in the same areas that you find cheetahs. Cheetahs and caracals were found in actually the same locations, and one of the things about these two species is they were both trained by humans to hunt animals on behalf of the humans. So the caracals were trained to hunt birds, rabbits, small gazelles, and of course the cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey. Very fascinating that both of these animals were not tamed, but conditioned by humans to hunt animals, and there was actually contests at one time between the caracals to see which one could kill the most birds, the most pigeons in a flock, and the cheetahs, which one could go fastest and bring down the biggest prey. For the most part, the smaller cats, the smaller predators, they eat animals relative to their size, so they would eat smaller birds or mice, but the caracals actually go after much larger prey. So one of the coolest things about the caracals is that they have this uncanny leaping ability, and they can actually catch birds on the wing. They've been recorded in the wild as jumping up to three meters high, which is almost about as high as I am right now. One of the other facts about caracals is they often live in the plains, and a lot of times they're found where the forest meets the plains. This does put them vulnerable to lions, hyenas, leopards, some of the bigger predators, and oftentimes they do fall prey to these larger animals. So they're not always the hunter, a lot of times they become the hunted. So one of the strange things about the caracal is in a lot of their range, especially in Asia and the Middle East, they're considered endangered, because they're very rare. And then on the other hand, in Africa, a lot of times caracals are considered nuisance, and they're just simply killed because they're a threat to livestock. Here at Big Cat Rescue, all of our caracals were former pets. Along with the serval, the caracal is just very popular among cat collectors, and probably one of the biggest misconceptions with the caracals is the fact that they are so cute when they are babies. They are the most adorable little kittens you've ever seen. Most people don't realize they're going to grow up to be this hissy animal that's going to spray on everything and try to bite you all the time. And there's been several attempts to hybridize these animals, some successful, some not successful, with domestic cats to give everyone sort of an exotic cat that's not quite wild. To me, that's a pretty shady thing to do. These are truly wild animals, great hunters out in the wild. They shouldn't be put in cages. They absolutely shouldn't be diluted down with domestic cat DNA. That's not what they were made to be. And here at Big Cat Rescue, of course, our philosophy is these animals belong in the wild, and the only way that we can ever accomplish that is if we preserve enough habitat in the \nComment: I find it amazing how people could actually try to kill them. Well.. Maybe if it was trying to kill you, but if they didn't even do anything?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Our Primate Cousins Photo slideshow of various primates I've worked with at a wild animal park (except the orangutans and gorillas, which were photographed elsewhere). Humans belong to the taxonomic Order Primates, which is comprised of 11 Families, 52 Genera, & 181 species. Primates are divided into two main groups: Prosimians (literally \"before monkeys/apes) and Anthropoids (literally \"man like\"). The evolution of primates is characterized by trends toward mobile limbs, grasping hands, a flattened face, binocular vision, a large, complex brain, & a reduced reproductive rate. Most Primates are well adapted to arboreal living (living in trees).Primate evolution occurred primarily during the Cenozoic Era, Prosimians first branching off in the early Eocene Epoch 58 mya (million years ago).Around 33 mya, during the Oligocene Epoch, the Anthropoids split off into 3 main groups: New World Monkeys (w/prehensile tails), Old World Monkeys (w/out prehensile tails), & the Hominoids (eventual Apes & Humans w/out any tails).In the Miocene Epoch, around 15 mya, Asian Apes & African Apes diverged paths. At approx. 6 mya, African Apes & Human lineage split, producing Hominids (members of the taxonomic Human Family Hominidae) in a region of Central Africa called the Great Rift Valley. There, dense jungle gave way to great savannah plains, & bipedalism became a helpful adaptation in surviving in a high grass environment w/a variety of predators. To this day, Chimpanzees & Humans share 98.5% of the same DNA sequences, even though millions of years separate us from a common ancestor. The evidence for evolution has been found within the fossil record. Additional corroboration has been found comparing DNA sequences which show dramatic linkages between all modern primate species. A comparative study of mitochondrial DNA shows that the differences among present human populations are consistent w/their having a common ancestor no more than a million years ago.Prosimian (lemurs, tarsiers, bushbabies & lorises)0:26-0:45 Ring Tailed LemurAnthropoids (monkeys, apes & humans)  New World Monkeys (w/prehensile tails)0:52-1:02 Black Tamarin Marmoset1:03-1:10 Squirrel Monkey1:11-1:18 Capuchin Monkey1:19-1:26 Woolly Monkey1:27-2:10 Spider Monkey **1:47-1:51 a spider monkey is investigating/ harassing a river turtle.**1:52-1:57 two spider monkeys are investigating/ harassing an alligator.Old World Monkeys (w/out prehensile tails)2:13-2:36 Vervet Monkey aka Green Monkey or Guenon or Grivet **These are the monkeys scientists have thus far linked as a carrier species for the RNA retrovirus associated w/HIV/AIDS.2:37-3:43 Rhesus Macaque**3:13-3:43 show a troop of rhesus macaques interacting w/Sika & Fallow deer, as well as Mouflon sheep & raccoons.Hominoids (apes & humans, w/out any tail) Asian Apes3:45-3:53 White Handed Gibbon3:54-4:08 OrangutanAfrican Apes4:11-4:32 Lowland Gorilla4:33-4:59 ChimpanzeeHuman4:52-4:59 Me kissing a Chimpanzee ^_^All photographs are the property of Dafttool & cannot be reproduced or used without the expressed authorization of Dafttool.\nTranscript: You You You You We Hey Everyone can see we're together All of the people around us they say Can they be that close?

But what happened is, I actually went down first. I kind of bushwhacked a little bit, you guys know how I like that, and then I hooked up with a trail later, and I was just, oh, I don't know, probably 50 yards ahead of him. And as I'm walking down, I'm almost to the street, and I notice a car was parked on the street right where our cars were parked, and it was just sitting there. I'm thinking, what is that car doing? As I walk and I come around this tree, I look over and there's a nice big old bull moose. And he's, well, he's not huge, but he's sitting there and he sees me come around the corner, he stops and he looks at me. And then my brother-in-law, Uncle Bingo, starts coming behind me, and I tell him to kind of be quiet because I want to get some film of this guy, and I kind of wave him over. But one thing I always talk about is looking for body language, and you're going to see it in this one. One of the signs of aggression that moose exhibit when you are in their space is they will often lower their heads, their ears will lay back on their heads. And then this guy, he started a beeline right at me. Now, what to look for here is, the first thing I did when I saw him, I thought, yeah, we're kind of close, but I'll be honest, you get a camera in my hand and all I'm thinking about is getting a shot. So I get my camera out, and when he starts coming at me, I'll edit this so it's kid-friendly. But I actually switched the camera to my left hand so that I could get my Glock 27 out of my ribs pack with my right, but it was just very sloppy because I'm trying to film him and I'm trying to get my gun out and I'm trying to watch him all at the same time. And anyway, I'll have you take a look at this, it's kind of fun. So of course, this is when I first see him. I get the camera right out of the pack. He hasn't seen me yet, but then he turns right here, bam, he sees me. Now it doesn't take him long, lower his head, see him lower his ears. Now, at this point, for some reason, I go into a weird accent and I'm trying to fish my Glock 27 out. Although I do have some good footage of you. Not really because it's so shaky. I think we're just kind of right in his way, there he goes, he's alright. Now what ensues here is me and Uncle Bingo just really enjoying the experience and talking about it, and it's very raw footage guys, it's just kind of a snapshot of this trip and a very unpolished snapshot of that. Is there two of them? Oh yeah, there is. Is it a bull or is it a cow? The thing is, is we're getting into rut season. And that means they get pretty ornery. Not quite though, but close. Looks like they're just doing their thing, I love this man, jeez. Good thing you stopped me, I came charging down the trail, making all kinds of sounds to scare bears, but. Uncle Bingo of course. You would have just took me out. I mean the cars are just right there, that's where the road is. And the bull moose and what we think is a cow. And we're pretty dang close to that bull moose right now. Let's see if I can... He's just right there, he's watching us. He's okay. He's alright. They really blend in if you're not watching. Yeah, they do don't they? As big as they are. Okay, this is what we're going to do. I'm going to film you. You run up, slap his butt, or spray paint it, and run as fast as you can. I'll tape the whole thing, this will be great YouTube footage. This will be like missing the Sasquatch a little bit. Okay, I'm in. Okay. We just forced him in the brush. Now see, I can't tell if he's eating or maybe... Look at this, maybe this is his bed. He's like, hey buddy. Get away from my bed. This is about as close as I dare get. We're probably 20 feet apart with a lot of brush in between us. He seems pretty calm. He's just gone about his business eating again. That's one thing I do, is really watch their body language. And understand where you are too. I know a lot of you guys tell me... I've had several guys in Alaska tell me, you could never do this. In Alaska with the moose that they have. Sorry guys, I'm not filming too well right now. I'm more watching him than trying to film him. Hey look, there's a baby. Awesome. Put him in your pack. What? Got straight up mauled by a cougar. Got on a buffalo. Buffalo sounds. We're approaching moose territory again. And this is our strategy. We've got plenty of sleeping bags. So if he charges us, we use the sleeping bag as a shield, punch him, wrestle him down, hog tie him. Good to go. I could do a drop kick to knock him over. That would be cool. We need to set up the camera though, so we can get it all on tape. Where's your action camera? Do you see that one? The bear one? That's freaking hilarious. He's right there, hanging out. He's the guy in the hat with the cool hat. Knock your hat, but it's not going to save you. Where he knocks the stove over. Knock the stove over on your foot. Ouch.\nComment: Omg Crockett you just killed me with that guy on a buffalo thing!! I'm dying laughing! Lol epic!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Momma squirrel moves her babies I was standing out back and watched momma squirrel move a baby, so I ran to grab the camera and recorded this.Nibbler is a tame wild pet squirrel that lives in the trees outside of my home. You can see all of his videos from birth onward at his Facebook page: \nTranscript: Watch this, she's grabbing a baby. I know this because she's moved one already. I was out here. Oh, here it goes. She's got a baby in her mouth. Look at that. It's not something you get to see every day. Mama squirrel has a baby. She's just taking it with her. I just ran inside to get the camera so I could get this. Oh, there's a nest right above my head there. There's one up there already. So now I know she has two babies. And I guess she decided that that nest is a better place than the box. And I have a feeling why. I wasn't leaving her alone. I put a bowl of food up there thinking I was doing her a favor. But now I realize that she doesn't want her babies near food. Because the food not only doesn't draw other squirrels, which would be a problem, but it draws other animals. So I made a mistake. I basically kicked her out of the nest box by giving her some food. So I learned something. She has another baby in her mouth right there. I don't know if it's on camera, but I can see it and I don't know where she's going with it. Oh, there's another nest. Look at that. She's just nest hopping with her babies. That's interesting. Well, so far I've seen two babies. That's one. And here she goes. Where did she go? Where'd you go, Mama Bear? There you are. Interesting. Oh, no, she's got a baby again. Look at that. She's trying out different nests. That is the craziest thing. I have never seen a squirrel moving a baby. There she is. She's going back. She's moving it back now. I don't believe it. She's putting it back. And it's just in her mouth and it's not crying or screaming or anything. Now she's putting it back. I don't believe it. I guess the nests weren't good enough. Okay. So now there's one baby back in the wooden box. I suspect she's going to come back here and grab the second one. That is crazy. Here she comes. She just popped out of the box and she's going to come back to where I am and grab the other baby. I know this because I saw her bring it over here. Hey, mama. Now she's going to go up to that nest straight up and get a baby. And I am going to show. Wouldn't it be interesting if these babies were nibblers? Obviously, there's no way to tell such a thing, but that would be cool. There she is. She's at the nest now. I can't tell because I'm looking straight up. I can't tell if the camera can see this. Okay, she's grabbed the baby. And it's in her mouth. Alright, here she comes. Oh my gosh, she's right in front of me. Hey sweetie, it's okay. Go on. Oh, and the baby's just hanging there. Oh, it's so cute. That is so cute. Alright, two babies safe in the box. I'll remember next time. I'm not going to put food up there anymore. Hopefully she keeps them there. Maybe I can tame up another pair of squirrels. That would be so neat.\nComment: Thanks for letting me know about leaving food. I thought leaving food would be good since Puppy will need to eat.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Laughing Hyena Best Laugh Sound Track Watch two LAUGHING hyenas with the best laugh ever while waiting for food at Out Of Africa in Camp Verde, Arizona.  The hyenas moo to show affection like a cat purrs.  Then they laugh when getting ready to eat.   They are one of the most intelligent and powerful animas in the world.  Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not.

The hyenas moo to show affection like a cat purrs.  Then they laugh when getting ready to eat.   They are one of the most intelligent and powerful animas in the world.  Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not.

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: And this is the work of the master builder among bower birds. I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: soooo cute!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This video was taken immediately following the charge and shows the aftermath of the mauling that never happened.\nTranscript: Okay, we're on Montague Island out of Port Chalmers and we're hiking up the mountain. We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around.\nComment: Hey AK, thanks for the educational video.

Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s.

But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned.

Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels.

The hyenas moo to show affection like a cat purrs.  Then they laugh when getting ready to eat.   They are one of the most intelligent and powerful animas in the world.  Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not.

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back. There we go. There we go. Don't say I don't love you. So I hope you enjoyed your walk with Georgie and Yami.

Humans belong to the taxonomic Order Primates, which is comprised of 11 Families, 52 Genera, & 181 species. Primates are divided into two main groups: Prosimians (literally \"before monkeys/apes) and Anthropoids (literally \"man like\"). The evolution of primates is characterized by trends toward mobile limbs, grasping hands, a flattened face, binocular vision, a large, complex brain, & a reduced reproductive rate. Most Primates are well adapted to arboreal living (living in trees).Primate evolution occurred primarily during the Cenozoic Era, Prosimians first branching off in the early Eocene Epoch 58 mya (million years ago).Around 33 mya, during the Oligocene Epoch, the Anthropoids split off into 3 main groups: New World Monkeys (w/prehensile tails), Old World Monkeys (w/out prehensile tails), & the Hominoids (eventual Apes & Humans w/out any tails).In the Miocene Epoch, around 15 mya, Asian Apes & African Apes diverged paths. At approx. 6 mya, African Apes & Human lineage split, producing Hominids (members of the taxonomic Human Family Hominidae) in a region of Central Africa called the Great Rift Valley. There, dense jungle gave way to great savannah plains, & bipedalism became a helpful adaptation in surviving in a high grass environment w/a variety of predators. To this day, Chimpanzees & Humans share 98.5% of the same DNA sequences, even though millions of years separate us from a common ancestor. The evidence for evolution has been found within the fossil record. Additional corroboration has been found comparing DNA sequences which show dramatic linkages between all modern primate species. A comparative study of mitochondrial DNA shows that the differences among present human populations are consistent w/their having a common ancestor no more than a million years ago.Prosimian (lemurs, tarsiers, bushbabies & lorises)0:26-0:45 Ring Tailed LemurAnthropoids (monkeys, apes & humans)  New World Monkeys (w/prehensile tails)0:52-1:02 Black Tamarin Marmoset1:03-1:10 Squirrel Monkey1:11-1:18 Capuchin Monkey1:19-1:26 Woolly Monkey1:27-2:10 Spider Monkey **1:47-1:51 a spider monkey is investigating/ harassing a river turtle.**1:52-1:57 two spider monkeys are investigating/ harassing an alligator.Old World Monkeys (w/out prehensile tails)2:13-2:36 Vervet Monkey aka Green Monkey or Guenon or Grivet **These are the monkeys scientists have thus far linked as a carrier species for the RNA retrovirus associated w/HIV/AIDS.2:37-3:43 Rhesus Macaque**3:13-3:43 show a troop of rhesus macaques interacting w/Sika & Fallow deer, as well as Mouflon sheep & raccoons.Hominoids (apes & humans, w/out any tail) Asian Apes3:45-3:53 White Handed Gibbon3:54-4:08 OrangutanAfrican Apes4:11-4:32 Lowland Gorilla4:33-4:59 ChimpanzeeHuman4:52-4:59 Me kissing a Chimpanzee ^_^All photographs are the property of Dafttool & cannot be reproduced or used without the expressed authorization of Dafttool.\nTranscript: You You You You We Hey Everyone can see we're together All of the people around us they say Can they be that close?

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: Cool. :3 You guys are awesome helping the big cats. I wanna be like you guys someday! :o"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

I go to put the mojo out and I come back, Andy's glassed in the field, he says stop what you're doing, I think I see a coyote. Sure enough, we look out, there's two little earsy spots and I just sit down and enough time for this dog to stand up, we lay on the calls and this dog comes sprinting in. Alright, ready? I'm ready.

Well, for the Hill Country, he's a nice little deer. And I decided to go ahead and take him. I had a good hunt. It was nice. And another deal was, the wind wasn't quite blowing right. It's kind of switching around because we have a front coming in. Right now it's 76 degrees here in Central Texas, but tomorrow it's going to be 35 degrees. So actually I was even hunting in shorts this evening. But anyway, the wind was swirling. The deer kept coming in. They were a little spooky. So I'll tell you what I did. I got this Muzzy's Bowhunter set up, the scrape juice, and I sprayed a little bit out the window. And he came in shortly afterwards, but I'll tell you what, don't spray it inside the blind. It smells pretty rough, but I bet deer really like it because I had never seen this buck before out of all the deer I've been watching for the past couple of weeks. And it brought him in, so I guess it works. But have a good evening. Muzzy Phantom did the job, shot him with a crossbow. Central Hill Country of Texas, and it's October 27th, 2010. Y'all have a good evening. We're going to try to go get some more venison here this season, but I guess I'm going to have to change clothes and get something warm. See y'all next time. Later.\nComment: G'day Wendy from Downunder.. What type of Crossbow are you usin as i have a cheepy from perfectline called a Cheetah with 185lb ...

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: yeah we need to preserve them"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Congo peafowls, or Congo peacocks, are splendid. They have those blue heads, and they're the national bird of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And they dwell mostly by the river basin.

And the great white pelicans have a wingspan of 7 to 11 feet. What the fuck? That is crazy. That's like a bumming 757. Now look at these black, these are African black ducks. They're very shy, yet territorial. Now look at this pelican, getting all primpy. And these are brown peafowls, just doing a little head dance in the water, waiting for fish. African black ducks, great white pelicans, all these birds just chilling, waiting for a chance to eat. Now what's nasty about the great white pelican is that they, while they mainly eat fish, they've been known to eat chicks and smaller birds. That is so nasty. Look at those legs.

In this highlight, Forsberg describes his mission to catch a bobcat with a camera trap in Nebraska.-----A nature photographer and Nebraska native, Michael Forsberg shares his work documenting this vast landscape, its lakes, prairies along with its plants and animals.The Great Plains are a dynamic but often forgotten landscape -- overlooked, undervalued, misunderstood, and in desperate need of conservation. Forsberg's book helps lead the way forward, informing and inspiring readers to recognize the wild spirit and splendor of this irreplaceable part of the planet. - California Academy of SciencesMichael Forsberg is a Nebraska native and has focused much of his work in North America's Great Plains, once one of the greatest grassland ecosystems on Earth. His goal has been to try to capture the wild spirit that still survives in these wide-open spaces and put a face to the often overlooked native creatures and landscapes found there. His hope is that the images can build appreciation and go to work to inspire conservation efforts on the land far into the future.Forsberg received a degree in geography with an emphasis in environmental studies from the University of Nebraska, and worked briefly as a seasonal ranger in the National Park Service before accepting a job as a staff photographer and writer producing natural history stories for NEBRASKAland Magazine, the state's conservation publication. He worked at the magazine for six years before starting his own photography business and gallery.Forsberg's work has appeared in publications including Audubon, National Geographic, National Wildlife, and Natural History, and recognized in the Pictures of the Year and Wildlife Photographer of the Year competitions. In 2001, his image of a Nebraska tallgrass prairie was selected for an International Postage Stamp. In 2004, he was awarded a Conservation Education Award from The Wildlife Society. Recently, he was featured in the PBS documentary \"Crane Song,\" and was the 2009 recipient of the North American Nature Photographer's Association Mission Award.\nTranscript: For a TV, the world is thinking. For these four years, I tried to photograph predators like wolves, grizzly bears, mountain lions, bison, all these creatures that still just barely exist in certain areas of their range. And we were successful on all those except for a bobcat. So when the field work was all done, I went back home and we had about three or four months to get the book out the door. And somebody called me from a little prairie outside of my hometown in Lincoln, Nebraska and said, we think we've seen a bobcat. You can try to photograph your bobcat here. So what the heck? So I went out and I put this camera trap up along this game trail. Here's the camera in a waterproof housing. Right here is a transmitter and a receiver where an infrared beam is going across this game trail. And here's a little flash. And here's a little flash right here. So if something walks down here and steps over that log, in theory the camera should take a picture, right? For the first two months, this is what I got. Nothing. I don't know if it was the prairie fairies or if it was my friends playing tricks on me or what, but we didn't get any pictures of anything other than just nothing. And then, finally, after the turn of the year, we started to get photographs. Raccoon first. Bunny rabbit. Farmer Jones cat down the road. Farmer Jones dog down the road. Good job, California. I got a call in early March 2009 from my publisher, and they said, Mike, you got to pull the plug. Book's got to go off to print. You're done. I went out to pick up the camera traps. I had two pictures in the last deal. Here's the first one. And then an hour later, and it was really great to end with that photograph because that's the last picture that was made for this book. And it sort of creates the arc in the story for me because the look in that bobcat's eye is that same look that I saw in that burrowing owl's eye maybe 10 years earlier. The other thing was was that after traveling and being gone away from my family for all that time, I took this photograph 15 minutes from my home in a prairie that's been restored.\nComment: Wow, he managed to take a photograph of those dangerous predatory bison!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

He was bouncing in the timber already, strutting out in front of us. I couldn't shoot him for a long time because he was so close to it, but I'm pretty sure we got a decent shot off. It didn't screw up the decoy too bad, but it put him down, so let's go out here and see what he looks like. Well, opening morning's paid off pretty good for us. I'd done some pretty good scouting here, and the pictures were showing the birds were here, but man, when we set up this morning, we wasn't very confident in it. We had some birds quite a ways behind us, and then over here across the creek, we knew there were some birds. Well, we even talked about getting up and moving, but we went ahead and stuck it out for another 20, 30 minutes, and one of the birds we'd heard over across the creek, evidently he had moved in on us, and we didn't see him until he was about 30 yards away.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: I loved this deformed white tiger - Kenny - I saw him at Turpentine Creek Wildife Refuge for many years before he died.

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: Poachers should be an endangered species!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.

Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: Thank you for watching and commenting.  You can learn everything you want to know about white tigers at BigCatRescue. org.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Winter Squirrel Hunting Winter squirrel hunting is a challenging and underutilized sport in Kansas. Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five.

This video was taken immediately following the charge and shows the aftermath of the mauling that never happened.\nTranscript: Okay, we're on Montague Island out of Port Chalmers and we're hiking up the mountain. We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around.

This is Wendy the Guide Girl, also known as Hawk Hunter Diva if you're watching YouTube. I'm sitting in my own back pasture instead of down at the leaves, shopping for some venison. I haven't seen anything I wanted to fling an arrow at yet. I'm in the antler hunting mode. So I got some new stuff from Buzzy. It's called Bowhunter Setup Scrape Juice. So I'm going to test that out today and see if I can't bring in something new. I see something just jumped the fence and I haven't seen it before. So let's check it out and see if he's a shooter. Well, good evening. Welcome to Butch and Wendy's Hunting Adventures. Hawk Hunter Diva decided to go try to get some venison. So we're here in the Hill Country, Texas. The deer are a little smaller up here compared to South Texas or up north, but we have a whole lot of them. I've been sitting in a pop-up blind watching a stream of does and little bucks and stuff. And I was actually after this eight point buck. He was nice and mature, but he didn't come in this morning. And while I was sitting there, this little ten point came in. Well, for the Hill Country, he's a nice little deer. And I decided to go ahead and take him. I had a good hunt. It was nice. And another deal was, the wind wasn't quite blowing right. It's kind of switching around because we have a front coming in. Right now it's 76 degrees here in Central Texas, but tomorrow it's going to be 35 degrees. So actually I was even hunting in shorts this evening. But anyway, the wind was swirling. The deer kept coming in. They were a little spooky. So I'll tell you what I did. I got this Muzzy's Bowhunter set up, the scrape juice, and I sprayed a little bit out the window. And he came in shortly afterwards, but I'll tell you what, don't spray it inside the blind. It smells pretty rough, but I bet deer really like it because I had never seen this buck before out of all the deer I've been watching for the past couple of weeks. And it brought him in, so I guess it works. But have a good evening. Muzzy Phantom did the job, shot him with a crossbow. Central Hill Country of Texas, and it's October 27th, 2010. Y'all have a good evening. We're going to try to go get some more venison here this season, but I guess I'm going to have to change clothes and get something warm. See y'all next time. Later.\nComment: @BnSRTVguy Thank you. This crossbow is a Horton Legend Pro 175. I just retired it and moved on to the next one laying around here. I just picked up the Horton Hunter 175 last week and already, it's seen some action. As a new shooter, you'll have questions and I can help with most if you need someone to help you out. I'm pretty sure I have more crossbow hunting experience than any other living soul right now. LOL! Been doing this a long time. Good Hunting and have fun down under!

I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: Fantastic video! - too short though....

These dogs like to run these guts, these ravines and so Andy and I made our way out there and we started making ourselves a little blind, took some old logs, stacking them up. I go to put the mojo out and I come back, Andy's glassed in the field, he says stop what you're doing, I think I see a coyote. Sure enough, we look out, there's two little earsy spots and I just sit down and enough time for this dog to stand up, we lay on the calls and this dog comes sprinting in. Alright, ready? I'm ready.

And it looks great. I think it's going to be a perfect night. We're going to get in, let things settle down, and we'll hope for the best. He's right there. Right there. He's not walking right. Perfect buck. He's going to drop his head real low every step. Dude, that was perfect. 20 yards right out of the wood line. Bush in the bag, baby. Ground blind. Perfect. Perfect. He's 100 yards. Perfect. Lunged him. Those TrueFire broadheads, Switchblade broadheads, fly like field points. There is no better flyer right now. Amazing. Awesome. What a buck. Had a limp. Great buck to take this time of season. Got my Zero Detect camo on, camo suit. I mean, goes perfect. It's early season. This brownface in the early season is perfect. You can skyline it. You can be on the ground. Couldn't ask for anything better. I can't thank Gibbs Archery Gear enough. Have you guys seen this bow sling that they got? It's better than anybody else's out there. Let's go find it. We shot this buck late in the evening, and we lost light. So I called Mike and helped him come out here and follow the blood trail. That's where we're at now. We're not too far away. We had a good frost last night, so it was able to freeze a lot of the blood on the leaves and in the soybean field. We've been able to track it very easily up until it got into this thick cover. I think we're pretty close. It's starting to clot up. We're finding it about every 10 yards, finding spots of blood, so it should be real close. Let's head down this way. Still on it here. I don't want to have to work along this bank. He's in the water. That's got to be my deer right there laying in the water. We're going to have to come up with a plan to get this thing out of here. I got a couple hooks on this. I think I can get him. He's maybe 17, 18 inches wide. Not a huge buck. But with that limp, he was a great buck to take. I mean, he's exactly what we were looking for out here. That's a good buck. Your second Ohio buck? This is my number two Ohio buck, yeah. Awesome deer. Yeah, I'm happy. Great way to find it, fishing it out of the water. This is the second deer I had head to water in Ohio, too. He's awesome. The hard part's done. We got him out of the water. Now I can just drag him on out. Get the four-wheeler down here and get him out of here. Alright, thanks man. No problem. Congratulations. That's awesome. you\nComment: And as for Nate's Gibbs Archery Gear bow sling, try one.  You'll never hunt without one again bi promise you that!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Jenny never wasted a day sulking about her abusive past. Her enthusiasm for life and adventure was contagious, and although her time on this earth was brief, we will continue to celebrate Jenny's spirit every day. Footnote: As you might imagine, Shirley was deeply grieved after losing Jenny, but we are happy to report that in the year following her passing, Shirley and Bunny have formed a much closer bond and now go everywhere together.Update: Bunny is now passed on, but Shirley has developed a friendly relationship with Tarra.

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

It was run as a cattle ranch and given to my parents in 1952 and handed over to Jane and I in 1977 to run. It was purely a cattle operation. 1983 Anna Mertz came to Lewa and offered to develop a rhino sanctuary on Lewa. I, Jane, we had a strong affiliation with wildlife and it was a wonderful opportunity for us to do something new and different and Lewa was the right place. So between 1983 and 1995 we looked after rhino in a very small area. 1995 we established a charitable organisation, the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, because everything was growing and we realised we had to go bigger if we were going to save rhino, that it was more about people and politics and money and all the dynamics around conservation than a single species. Lewa Downs as such, the ecological unit of Lewa Downs is 62,000 acres. Some of that is a national forest reserve owned by government. The rest of that land is owned by different parts of my family and as a family we all know that we have a massive responsibility in caring for that land, for caring for the Grevy's zebra, for the black rhino on that land. Like every family in the world, we have children, we want to pass on what we own to our children and it's a threat to Lewa. It's going to divide the core ownership of it and so my brother, my sister and I have come together and with the support of my parents and said let's put this into an organisation that's going to take it beyond us and TNC have guided us carefully over the last two years through that process and so the land that's been in my family since 1922 will be in a Kenya-based charitable organisation focused on conservation that will take our work into the foreseeable future. Once TNC made the decision to come into Africa, I think there was a sort of gravitational connection there. There was an obvious connection in a lot of key issues that where we were weak and TNC was strong. We were ground-based, we were relatively humble, we had the buy-in of the communities and the government but we didn't have an international reach and we didn't have the expertise, the technical expertise to sort of formalise a lot of the issues that we were doing here on the ground. It's this expertise that's evolved and is available within TNC and that's what's been so valuable to us in this relationship.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Top 3 Most Memorable Wild Animal Experiences Spawned from a viewer comment, I discuss 2 (actually 3) of my most memorable animal experiences while in the backcountry. And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: Encounter with a tiny mule deer with a friend I consider a big brother, he was teaching me stalking, it snorted loud. I will never forget it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection. It's just something that we've been doing for a long time. We're very passionate about our care for animals and we want to share that with everyone.\nComment: They need a longer running place to run!\n Beautiful Sleek and Deadly\n I look at my black Persian and smile that shes small at 20pds :D \nMy father (Bless His Soul, I miss him) used to say I had a cat as a living ornament, better than a radio shack white cat.(telling my age.lol)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: Mandy is SO CUTE!

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: iFly TV: Inspiring People Katherine Conner of BLES iFly KLM Magazine travels to Thailand to interview Katherine Conner who devotes her life to the wellbeing of elephants.\nTranscript: When people travel to Thailand, the thing that they want to do is to see an elephant, to ride an elephant, to feed an elephant. What a lot of people don't realize is the abuse that builds up to allowing that elephant to allow you to mount its back and to ride it. Many female elephants, when they give birth, they will actually kill their calves. And I feel that that is because they know what kind of life that baby is going to have and they don't want the baby to go through it. So they would rather just kill it as soon as it's born. It's a chain of cruelty that we have to stop right now. And the people who can stop it are the tourists coming to Thailand. They are the ones with the power. I am Catherine Connor, the founder of Bunlok Elephant Sanctuary Bless in Sukhothai, Thailand. Here, our number one priority is the elephant's welfare. We're not interested in profit. We're not interested in keeping the tourists happy. We just want to make a difference to the lives of these abused elephants. The rhythm here is beautiful. It's slow. We work on elephant time. You know, when the elephants want to go, we follow. If they want to stop and graze, we wait. And I think that for a lot of people who come here, it's a whole different world. It's a whole different way of looking and dealing with life. And I think that we change people when they come here. Here we have Phang Noi and Phang Soi. And behind you, you have Wassana, Lotus and Phang Dao. And they are collectively known as the Gossip Girls because they are non-stop trumpeting, roaring, squeaking, purring. You see, normally the cameras are all on them. People are wondering when it's going to be their turn. I have always had a passion for animals. And when I came to Thailand, I knew I wanted to see elephants. I began to volunteer at an elephant center in North Thailand. And I met a baby elephant called Bunrot, which is Thai for survivor. That baby elephant reached out and touched me. He changed my life forever. If he hadn't have died, I'm not sure I would have created BLAST because I would have just all my attention and all my focus and all my funds would have been going on to him. Elephants in Thailand, they were always held in very high regard. They were used for logging. And in 1989, Thailand banned that. And so what happened was thousands of elephants and their owners were unemployed. So what do they do? They're not going to give up their elephant. They need to provide for their family. That is when elephant tourism was born. Elephants are forced to perform tricks and the training that goes on to achieve that is diabolical. They're put through a breaking process. The baby elephant is stabbed repeatedly and beaten repeatedly until the spirit is broken. What it then becomes is a machine for the tourist trade. This is Bunthong. We found her in a tourist camp in Pattaya, giving trekking rides. So that means she had that big heavy chair on her back. As a result of years of doing that, she has a broken back. This is Wassana. She stood on a landmine when she was illegally logging on one of the Thai borders. Despite the fact that she is missing parts of her front foot, she was still sold into the tourist trade and forced to give rides. I mean at the end of the day, I don't think any of us are cruel. And I think most of the cruelty that goes on with elephants in Thailand is lack of education. I think most of these elephant owners don't know the damage that they're doing to their elephant's spine and joints. If they knew, I would hope that they would stop. At Bless, we have three guest houses that sleep two people each. We charge people to stay here. We have no programme, no schedule. We never encourage our guests to approach the elephant, encroach on their space. Our vision is to rescue the abused elephants, to recuperate them, to teach them how to be elephants again and then to release them onto protected land where they can live as wild elephants again. One of the biggest things for me, the thing that amazes me about them the most, is their ability to forgive. You know, these elephants, all of them have been abused by us, by humans. And yet, here they are, comfortable, accepting us, allowing us into their space, allowing us to walk along beside them. I just find that incredible.\nComment: I love my BLES family. <3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

That's the pond pulled to bits, we've removed the large stones from around the side, we've kept them fairly local, just tipped them over the back there to allow us to reshape the top shelf, we've whipped the liner out, there was a little bit of underlay in, carpet underlay, probably covering about 20% of the pond, so it was there as a token gesture, no more, we've dragged the cobbles back a little bit, that'll allow us to build a proper shelf here to retain the cobbles and then just push them back in so they don't need to be moved twice, same with the stones, once we get the shelves done around the sides we'll just be able to lift the stones back into position and cement them in. Right this morning we've reshaped the pond, we've dug the shelves a little bit deeper all the way around the edges, we've created a new shelf around here, the idea being to put a little bit of cement all the way along here, cement in some of these fellas and then pile the rest behind it to prevent them falling in. We've made this inner shelf around here a little bit taller, i.e. a little bit nearer the surface because there wasn't much space for putting marginal plants before, that shelf was pretty deep, it was about 18 inches, which is no good for most plants, we've made another little shelf in the bottom here and we've basically just flattened everything out, ready for the underlay. That's the underlay in now, more or less went in in two long sheets, that's one sheet, that's another sheet, we've sealed it with a heat gun, basically just put a little bit of fire between the two layers and pressed them together in this stick. So now it's time for the liner. That's the liner in now, it's one mil rubber, Firestone liner, we've started filling it up, we're probably going to fill it up until it's just over this shelf here, that should pull the liner in enough for us to work on this top shelf, cementing the stones in. It's pretty important to fill it up sufficiently so it pulls the liner in and makes it tight, otherwise if you just bray on and put the edging stones on when the liner's loose, when you fill it up, it can pull the edging stones in and make a real mess. This is the edging just about half done, we're putting a little ring of cobbles cemented in around the beach edge here, then we can cut the liner off, pour the cobbles back over that and it retains the cobbles quite nicely. We've gone round the sides with stone, well gone halfway round the side with stone, obviously the water's still got quite a long way to come up, but we're going to stop it just shy of those stones there, just in case we get any rain overnight, we don't want it to affect the cement that we've put on. All these gaps will be filled in with soil and then we'll cut the liner off. It's coming together quite well. It's the end of today, we've cemented all the edging stones on, put the cobbles back in position, had a bit of a tidy up around the edges, the water's still got to go up by 8 or 9 inches or so to cover the exposed liner there, but we're leaving it at this level just so it doesn't interfere with the cement. So really now all there is to do is just leave it for a couple of days, top it up and then get the video of the finished pond. That's about it. We've filled the pond up to about 6 inches below its full level, that's to allow the cement that we put around here to go off properly, that was the last bit of cementing that we did, so it'll still come up, probably halfway up these stones that surround the pond here. It's reasonably clear because most of it is water straight out of the tap, although we did put a little bit of pond water back in, it was probably about 300-400 litres went back in. That's it, another one down. If you've liked this video, click the like button, give it a thumbs up, if you haven't liked it, go away and watch some cat playing a blooming keyboard or something.

With him I had the privilege of watching and recording a very special moment for this story: dingo pups being born in their lair.It is just one special moment in a story about a farmer who has come up with an unusual way of keeping wild dogs under control on his property.    by Ant On Wax\"Before You Accuse Me\" blues standard performed by Harmonica Rick Gibson soundcloud.com/harmonica-rick-gibson\nTranscript: Australian farmers have a responsibility to control dingoes, or wild dogs, that are running on their property. So about three years ago, I made a decision to change my strategy about controlling wild dogs on my property and decided to go and look for the young at brooding time, which was July. The dingoes have their pups in July. And I was lucky enough to find two litters, and having reared a couple of those dingoes, I got to the understanding that I could probably try a policy of having my own dingo pack and regularly walk them around my property and might be able to control the other of the wild dingo pack by letting them know there was already a pack of dogs in this area. The culmination of my efforts through removing these pups from the hollow logs means that now I have mature dingoes, who are now brooding age, and just only a few nights ago I was very privileged to be present for the birth of my own. I'm right up close and it's all happening just natural like a wood in the bush, except the dingo doesn't have a fear of me and accepts me in. I just feel so privileged to be able to be right up close to something that is normally so secretive. An interesting characteristic I found with dingoes, they don't normally bark, but they have a whole heap of other noises they make in communication, quiet communications, and they do a very throaty, I think a dingo could almost talk. Come up here baby. Yes I will. My lovely dingo baby. Go on. And I learned early on sitting here by the campfire, when I had dingo pups beside me, that when I played the harmonica, they all went into howl. I don't really know whether they think I'm sad or what it is with the harmonica that really gets into them, but all they want to do is come and sit beside me and howl with me. I feed my dingoes a variety of foods. I like to get a big boiler, half fill it with water, put in vegetables. I try to give them as much native food that they would naturally have got themselves. You can't always count on a roadkill kangaroo or something coming along when you need it. They all seem quite happy. I think they do well on it as a matter of fact. I feel privileged to have actually seen what happens with dingoes right up close. They're so misunderstood in Australia. I really realise how much they have accepted me as I'm just one of a number. And I have some very good traits. All dingoes have their part in the pack. I suppose one of my best traits must be they consider me a good cook. Baa! Eee! No! Mm-mm!\nComment: I ve seen an aussie Punching KANGO ROO to save his Dingo.\nI just see an aussie Playing harmonica to sing his Dingo,"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

For more information go to \nTranscript: This is a barn owl. Wow, it's such a beautiful bird. Look at some of its amazing adaptations. It's got this incredible heart-shaped face. Now the facial disc actually gathers sound in the same way as your ears do. The ears are actually just behind the eyes within the feathers, which are really hard to see. And when it's hunting, it can actually hear the sounds of small mammals on the ground below, which is incredible. Its flight is very, very quiet, partly because the feathers are so soft and the body is so light, it passes through the air really, really gently. The legs are really, really long, which is an adaptation for diving into long grass and catching the small mammals which they feed on. The eyesight is amazing as well. Barn owls are able to detect movement when there's hardly any light. It's just such an incredible bird. But unfortunately, there are some problems with the barn owl because of these specialisations. Adapted for hunting from the air, it has to be very light. Barn owls can't put on a lot of fat to help them get through the winter. And also, its feathers, which are so soft and not particularly waterproof, so a barn owl can't hunt during the rain. And so the weather has an effect, food shortage has an effect, and numbers of barn owls go up and down tremendously in response to these environmental changes. It's a sad fact that barn owls have declined tremendously, particularly since World War II. The landscape upon which we all depend has changed tremendously. And barn owls have declined because of a reduction in food supply, because of intensive agriculture, loss of hedgerows, loss of old pasture, loss of the rough grassland with all those small mammals in it. Unfortunately, they're prone to accidental deaths. They die from flying into things like motor vehicles on motorways. And a lot of barn owls starve to death because of a lack of food. So the numbers have gone down by at least 70% since the 1930s, which is something we're really trying to address. Because of their rarity, barn owls are afforded special legal protection. They're not only protected against being killed, as are most wild birds, but they're also protected against disturbance whilst they're nesting. Barn owls are also known as an indicator species. If there are barn owls, plenty of them, in the environment, then that's an indication that actually the food chain is really healthy. There's lots of nice, rough habitat supporting lots of small mammals, supporting barn owls. And if you have that habitat, of course, there's so much other biodiversity which will be supported by it. To find out more, why not explore the website?\nComment: My wife and I live near a lake with a lot of trees.  Two baby Barn Owls apparently fell out of their nest and landed in our yard.  Our dog had them cornered before we intervened - the owls were screaming and the dog was barking.  The owls were so young they could not fly yet.  But they sure could scream!  We rescued them from our dog and brought them in our house.  I dropped a towel on them and they quickly calmed down.  We put them in our guest bathroom behind the shower doors in the bathtub.  We kept them for 2 weeks.  We fed them feeder mice starting with \"pinkies\" then \"fuzzies\".  Eventually, we upgraded their diet to \"hoppers\".  Just before we let the owls go, we fed them live small adult mice.  They gobbled them up.  We let the owls go a few days ago.  We thought we'd never see them again.  The very next night (to our delight) both of them returned to a tree nearest our house.  They were squawking like crazy standing side by side, wing to wing.  Right after sunset they return to our trees and start their hunting activity.  We feel very lucky that we had the opportunity to save those helpless little guys.  Apparently, our home has become their home."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Walking around you can gaze upon some of the more amazing animals from around the world. From some of the largest to the downright deadly. Zoos offer the average Joe, and his family, a glimpse into the wonders of the natural world. The zoo can trace its origins back to a more family unfriendly time, to ancient Egypt, when for the pharaoh, owning a hippo zoo was completely normal. It was only into the 19th century when the roaring industrial masses wanted a piece of the action, and science was taking off that the modern zoo was born. And sure, zoos have received bad press in the past, but the modern zoo has been reinvented as a centre of science and conservation. So what are the roles of a modern zoo? Well, roughly speaking, we can divide them into three categories, education, breeding centres, and research. So let's start with education. It's simple really, zoos are a fun and safe place to learn for both kids and adults. The fact is, the animals are real, and you can get up and close to some of the more exotic and threatened creatures from around the world. Every year, 150 million people visit zoos around the world, and it's so important that the next generation is educated and understands the role they play in preserving our planet. Better still, many zoos have education centres with dedicated teams who aim to teach kids about everything from ecosystem services to climate change. Zoos also play an important role as breeding centres. Most zoos these days are part of organisations set up to coordinate breeding programmes and keep standards high. This means your favourite animal like the chimpanzee here is probably part of some national or even international breeding programme. These help zoos maintain genetic diversity and are extremely important for species that are threatened with extinction in the wild. One example is the scimitar-horned oryx. This is a species that became extinct in the wild and only survived in zoos and private collections. It is now part of several international breeding programmes and the hope is one day it will be reintroduced into the wild. And finally, Zoos offer a unique opportunity for biologists. Instead of spending days trying to track down an animal and becoming exhausted in the process, zoos offer a more controlled environment where effective research can be undertaken. Take the devastating disease chytridiomycosis. This has caused dramatic declines and even extinction in at least 200 species of frog. Zoos are actively taking part in research aiming to stop the spread of this disease. Research in zoos contribute to a number of scientific fields including animal behaviour and endocrinology, all ultimately contributing to the conservation of our biodiversity. So sure, a trip to the zoo is a great family day out, but zoos these days aren't there to show off your new hippo. Zoos are centres for conservation, educating the new generation, giving critically endangered species another chance and helping us gather knowledge for the conservation of species and biodiversity.

It was run as a cattle ranch and given to my parents in 1952 and handed over to Jane and I in 1977 to run. It was purely a cattle operation. 1983 Anna Mertz came to Lewa and offered to develop a rhino sanctuary on Lewa. I, Jane, we had a strong affiliation with wildlife and it was a wonderful opportunity for us to do something new and different and Lewa was the right place. So between 1983 and 1995 we looked after rhino in a very small area. 1995 we established a charitable organisation, the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, because everything was growing and we realised we had to go bigger if we were going to save rhino, that it was more about people and politics and money and all the dynamics around conservation than a single species. Lewa Downs as such, the ecological unit of Lewa Downs is 62,000 acres. Some of that is a national forest reserve owned by government. The rest of that land is owned by different parts of my family and as a family we all know that we have a massive responsibility in caring for that land, for caring for the Grevy's zebra, for the black rhino on that land. Like every family in the world, we have children, we want to pass on what we own to our children and it's a threat to Lewa. It's going to divide the core ownership of it and so my brother, my sister and I have come together and with the support of my parents and said let's put this into an organisation that's going to take it beyond us and TNC have guided us carefully over the last two years through that process and so the land that's been in my family since 1922 will be in a Kenya-based charitable organisation focused on conservation that will take our work into the foreseeable future. Once TNC made the decision to come into Africa, I think there was a sort of gravitational connection there. There was an obvious connection in a lot of key issues that where we were weak and TNC was strong. We were ground-based, we were relatively humble, we had the buy-in of the communities and the government but we didn't have an international reach and we didn't have the expertise, the technical expertise to sort of formalise a lot of the issues that we were doing here on the ground. It's this expertise that's evolved and is available within TNC and that's what's been so valuable to us in this relationship.

Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five. I'm Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism.\nComment: I was in the woods squirrel hunting for the first time for 4 hours yesterday and saw 3, shot at none.  The leaves are still so thick it's hard to see far at all and the woods are full of oak trees.  Acorns were showering down everywhere so there I couldn't decide where to rest up.  When I checked out I saw that nobody got any squirrels in the past week so that made me feel better."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: @kookiemoose Great Experience! but would have to say we were very lucky to have been able to drive through a Buffalo heard like that considering how vast that park is.

This footage was shot at beautiful Animal Kingdom (Disney) in Orlando, Fl.\nTranscript: The large flying fox is one of the biggest bats in the world. Even though it may weigh, on average, only two pounds, its wingspan can get to around six feet wide. That is one of the reasons this bat belongs to the suborder, megabat. Or as I say, the suborder, MEGABAT! These large bats are just one of many species of flying fox. They get their name due to their heads, which up close, sort of look like a fox with their pointed ears. These large flying fox come from the islands of Southeast Asia. They will roost high up in the trees and they will become active at sunrise and at sunset. So they aren't strictly nocturnal. And since they're considered an old world bat, they also can't echolocate like some other bats can. So they rely on their sense of smell and strong eyesight to locate food. Food for these large bats is pollen, leaves, flowers, and fruits. So you don't have to worry, they're not going to suck your blood. They play an important role where they can take fruit seeds from one island to another to help the fruits grow in new locations. Now unfortunately, they are often seen as pests since they eat flowers and they then are over hunted. These large flying foxes also need a lot of trees and in Southeast Asia, a lot of forests and jungles are being cut down due to the growing human population and a need for more space. The flying fox will usually give birth to just one pup so it's very important to conserve each and every large bat we see. Their young will stay with them for around 12 to 14 weeks and then they become mature enough to go out on their own. For more information on the flying fox, please read this video's description below. And as always, thanks for watching!\nComment: Yes, it was cool to film these large bats, since the majority of bats are small enough to fit into your hand."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Well what Kai does is he's actually got a big mud bath in his enclosure. It's pretty cool. He gets a bit dirty. Sometimes when he has that mud all over him, he loves it if you can just pick it off and scratch. It just kind of feels like a massage. They have that mud on their back to help them as like a sunscreen and a mosquito repellent. They actually can't see really well. But Robert, what can they do? They have really, really good hearing. And what's funny about Kai is if you look just on his ears, he's got those little tufts of fur. Isn't that silly? We're not really sure why he has it. Maybe it's to keep the dust out of his ears. This is the white rhino. And they're different from their cousin, the black rhino, for a few different reasons. Firstly, these guys are grazers. So if you look at their mouth, they have that real rectangular shape and really big squishy lips. That's because they eat things like grass. But if you compare them to their cousin, the black rhino, they have a more triangular shaped mouth, don't they? Yeah. It's really pointy. And do you know why they have that? That's because they eat different foods. It's true. So they eat more like things like shrubs. Yeah, so rhinos can actually grow up to be two tons. They're really, really heavy. It's true. Now, the poor rhinos are in a lot of trouble. They're actually critically endangered because of that gorgeous horn. That horn is made out of keratin, which is the same as our fingernails. What people do is they'll kill the rhinos for that horn to turn it into traditional medicine. The biggest thing to protect rhinos or any wildlife is to never, ever buy wildlife products. Kai is one of our biggest animals here at Australia Zoo. But we have lots more, both big and small. So make sure you tune in next time. Yeah, and remember to subscribe to the Pet Collective channel. See ya.

As the hours pass, I realize something's wrong. Even the band's stallion, Boomer, tries to encourage the foal. That's when another band moves into the meadow, led by the husky stallion, Looking Glass. Boomer's little band moves away. And the foal tries, but cannot follow. Looking Glass's lead mare notices something in the grass. She's joined by a second mare and a young stallion. She seems to encourage the foal, while Boomer's band looks on. Then Looking Glass approaches. And I was shocked at what happened next. The mares try to stop him. Boomer charges in, but it's too late. I tell myself the stallion did the foal a favor, saving it from a lingering death. But Looking Glass's aggression is disturbing and haunting.\nComment: Whoa, there needs to be a disclaimer here.

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back.

Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five. I'm Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism.\nComment: Remember, speed thirlls, but its energy that kills. A .22 air gun going 600 FPS with 10 FPE can kill a squirrel."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

So for the element of surprise, the peregrine falcon has to resort to sheer speed. In a dive, it's the fastest bird in the world. So fast, it's breathtaking. It stalks by flying high and relying on eyes that are as good as telescopes. The fat, slow-looking pigeon might seem to be doomed, but it evolved as peregrines evolved and is equipped to watch for them. Eyes on the side of its head Eyes on the side of its head enable the pigeon to forage for seed and scan the sky at the same time. It spies the peregrine. And once it's in the air, it becomes a racer. The peregrine, lightness, streamlining, speed. The pigeon, strength, endurance, enough speed. And a head start. The peregrine is more manoeuvrable. The pigeon has a wider field of vision and plenty of manoeuvres of its own. It's also flying for its life. This time, the pigeon outflies its pursuer. This peregrine is still young and just learning that she can fly. But speed by itself isn't always enough. It must race its game.\nComment: Some of my pigeons do the same thing.

Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Can't believe its been 10 years since we unloaded Flav from the truck and into his sanctuary home. He still looks great!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

There were a few notices put up by the hotel indicating that wild animals are not to be fed. Since this squirrel looked rather tame and more familiar with the surroundings I thought of giving it a banana :) May be it was used to the hotel guests feeding it. I was very close and was able to admire it while it was feeding itself. The surrounding of the resort hotel chalet where we stayed was rather interior and was bordering a Wildlife Sanctuary. Grizzled Giant Squirrel - (Ratufa Macroura) ================================= The grizzled giant squirrel is a large tree squirrel found in the highlands of Sri Lanka and India. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as near threatened due to habitat loss and hunting. Countries - Native - India , Sri Lanka Taxonomic Notes - There are three very distinct subspecies, with one present in India and all three present in Sri Lanka. Red List Category & Criteria - Near Threatened Justification - Listed as Near Threatened because this species is probably in significant decline due to habitat loss and hunting throughout much of its range. Range Description - This species is endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. In India it is known from only five severely fragmented locations, while it occurs more widely and less fragmented in Sri Lanka. Population - The Indian population has been estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals, and the population has been decling due to habitat loss and hunting The population of this species is considerably higher in Sri Lanka. Habitat and Ecology - It is a diurnal and arboreal species. It occurs in tropical dry deciduous and montane forests, where it is confined to the riverine habitats. It has a generation time of ~7-8 years. Major Threats- Habitat loss and degradation due to agro-industry farming, small-scale logging, selective logging, increase in human settlements, forest fire, inter-specific competition, competition from alien species, hunting for local consumption purposes, presence of domestic predators have been observed to be the major threats for this species. The grizzled giant squirrel's common name came from the grey to brown colouration highlighted with white at the top of the tail, giving it a grizzled appearance. The rest of the body varies in colour geographically and may be brown, red, grey or black, but the fur on the underside is always lighter than the back. This agile climber is adapted for life spent almost entirely in the trees, and has a very long tail for balance, broad hands for climbing and large claws for gripping branches. The ears are short, round and sometimes tufted.Music By Lohstana David from Jamendo .com\nTranscript: \nComment: @StowAlex It is a pleasure to hear that you liked it and thank you so much for your visits my Dear..

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: Very sad, indeed..."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Caracals are sometimes called desert lynx, but in all reality, they are more closely related to your domestic cat at home than to any of the lynx, being either Siberian lynx or Canadian lynx. One of the characteristics that make them very unique is the fact that they have a pretty plain solid coat. There are only a few other cats that have that sort of coat without markings, and that would be cougars and lions, and strangely enough, they are about the same color as the caracals. The caracals have jet black ears, the back of their ears are black, and they have long tufts, just like the lynx, so that's probably why a lot of people associated them with the lynx or thought they were related. So caracals are found throughout Africa, and they're actually found through the Middle East and parts of Asia, and strangely enough, geographically, caracals are found in the same areas that you find cheetahs. Cheetahs and caracals were found in actually the same locations, and one of the things about these two species is they were both trained by humans to hunt animals on behalf of the humans. So the caracals were trained to hunt birds, rabbits, small gazelles, and of course the cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey. Very fascinating that both of these animals were not tamed, but conditioned by humans to hunt animals, and there was actually contests at one time between the caracals to see which one could kill the most birds, the most pigeons in a flock, and the cheetahs, which one could go fastest and bring down the biggest prey. For the most part, the smaller cats, the smaller predators, they eat animals relative to their size, so they would eat smaller birds or mice, but the caracals actually go after much larger prey. So one of the coolest things about the caracals is that they have this uncanny leaping ability, and they can actually catch birds on the wing. They've been recorded in the wild as jumping up to three meters high, which is almost about as high as I am right now. One of the other facts about caracals is they often live in the plains, and a lot of times they're found where the forest meets the plains. This does put them vulnerable to lions, hyenas, leopards, some of the bigger predators, and oftentimes they do fall prey to these larger animals. So they're not always the hunter, a lot of times they become the hunted. So one of the strange things about the caracal is in a lot of their range, especially in Asia and the Middle East, they're considered endangered, because they're very rare. And then on the other hand, in Africa, a lot of times caracals are considered nuisance, and they're just simply killed because they're a threat to livestock. Here at Big Cat Rescue, all of our caracals were former pets. Along with the serval, the caracal is just very popular among cat collectors, and probably one of the biggest misconceptions with the caracals is the fact that they are so cute when they are babies. They are the most adorable little kittens you've ever seen. Most people don't realize they're going to grow up to be this hissy animal that's going to spray on everything and try to bite you all the time. And there's been several attempts to hybridize these animals, some successful, some not successful, with domestic cats to give everyone sort of an exotic cat that's not quite wild. To me, that's a pretty shady thing to do. These are truly wild animals, great hunters out in the wild. They shouldn't be put in cages. They absolutely shouldn't be diluted down with domestic cat DNA. That's not what they were made to be. And here at Big Cat Rescue, of course, our philosophy is these animals belong in the wild, and the only way that we can ever accomplish that is if we preserve enough habitat in the \nComment: There are over 320 videos on our channels and I do believe there are a couple that talk about ligers.

Join Todd Graf and Dean Kreuger both shoot trophy whitetail bucks and have to back out before recovering them the next day.  The rut continues right here on Bowhunt or Die!\nTranscript: Bowhunter Dye is being brought to you by Matthews, Lost Camo, New Archery Products, J.B. Tinks, Lone Wolf Portable Tree Stands, Scent Blocker, Campbell Cameras, and Stealth Cam. Welcome to another action-packed episode of Bowhunter Dye. I'm Justin Zarr and alongside me as always is Todd Graff. You know, Todd, we've got two more really exciting buck hunts to share with our audience this week. We do. You know, it's been a great year. I've been fortunate enough to harvest my second buck here in Illinois. It's a buck's name is Captain Hook. It turned out to be quite the adventure on the recovery but it did work out okay in the end. Yeah, you know, I actually got to play a little part in that recovery but, you know, last week we talked about backing out after an unsure hit which is what you did and actually the other buck that we're going to feature this week which came from Dean Krieger, kind of the same scenario. He was a little bit unsure of the hit so he backed out and, you know, fortunately was able to recover his buck the next day. Right, you know, it's difficult to pull out. It makes really for a sick sleeping evening but in the end it is the smartest thing to do. Well, let's jump right in a tree with Todd on his hunt for Captain Hook. Beautiful buck. I don't know if he went down over there or not, guys. I made a nice Tony Vineyard shot. It looked to me to be a good shot. Oh, he popped right out of this corn. Scared those two smaller bucks away. I'm gonna have to re-watch the footage. I don't know how good of a shot I made or didn't make. I mean, it looked like it wasn't bad but he just didn't act the way I wanted him to act. I may have only got one lung. Let's get out of here. I've learned from experience when you find yourself in situations you just gotta back out, be calm, don't disturb the area. Hopefully he will not go far and he'll expire. Well, the Calvary has arrived. Mike and Justin just showed up. They're not hunting that far away from here so luckily they were able to come give me a hand. You know, that buck came in and I blew it. There's no question about it. I could have been a little bit more calm and I shouldn't have punched the trigger like the way I did. That buck was totally calm. I should have just gave him two more steps and I would have probably had a much better broadside double lung shot but you know what? We did all the stuff right. We pulled out. It's been over four and a half hours now so we're gonna go over at the point of impact, see if we can find my arrow. I'm pretty positive it was a pass through. We've watched the footage over and over and over. He went about 30-40 yards and just stood there for a while so let's see what we can find. I'm hoping that this buck didn't go too far. Let's take a look. We got some blood right here guys. I mean there hasn't been a lot of blood but we're still on the trail so that definitely makes me feel better. We just jumped him. That's not a good sign. That's enough to make you sick right there guys. Wait until tomorrow on this one. I'm here with my friend Scott Hill. He's my neighbor. You know what? It's so great when you got good neighbors when you own hunting property. There's nothing better and more valuable than a good neighbor. Scott was nice enough to, actually he was super nice. He left his wife go hunting this morning and he came out here and helped me track. You know, he went about another 100 yards. We found about four more beds. We just came up around the hill over here and there he is. He's laying right over there. He must have just went up the hill and then came back down. Oh my gosh guys. What an awesome looking deer. Come on take a look at this buck. It's November 7th. You know what? I found my buck, thank goodness, this morning. I shot him yesterday morning. I had great footage. You know, the buck came right in. Unfortunately, I made a mistake. I should have gave that buck at least a couple more seconds and he probably would have turned broadside to me. He's a good four and a half year old. Nice brown horns, heavy mass. He's got this really unique right side. There's nothing better than shooting a freak buck. I can't wait to check my stealth cams out. I'm hoping I got a couple videos up because this is really a good looking buck. He's just a good heavy horn. Nice looking buck. I am extremely happy. I am tagged out in Illinois. I'm going to head now to Wisconsin. I've got two tags left in Wisconsin. I'm going to head up there and see what I can get done in Wisconsin. It's been three years since I put one down up there.\nComment: Thanks for th einsightful commentary!

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.

PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: I understand. I remember when I first learned it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

She told her to go and to be free and to eat. And that's exactly what she's done, and she's been just a wonderful animal. She's really enjoyed Crackle. Here of late, though, she's been sick. We found her in her den, just being cold and unresponsive, so we brought her into the camp hospital. And our big cat rescuers have been hand-feeding her and giving her lots of attention. She's perked up beautifully, and it's raining outside. So until we have better weather, we'll keep her inside here. We're going to keep her warm and dry.

Up backpacking with the kids and brother-in-laws Uncle Bingo and I had a close encounter with a Bull Moose. Returning to the car to gather extra gear for the kids at dusk, turned a bend on the trail and a bull moose was not too far off. I was in his comfort zone and he let me know it. Some very raw footage and just a snapshot of the trip. Also, Bingo and I having some fun talking about the youtube series \"Guy on a Buffalo.\" Personally I find it funny.Please visit \nTranscript: Let me set up this video for you. So I went backpacking, well, if you want to call it backpacking, with my kids, my brother-in-laws and their kids. Because we had so many young kids with us, we actually didn't go in very far at all. But we went in, found a spot, dropped all our stuff, and some of the adults stayed with the kids, and me and Uncle Bingo, actually, you've seen him in my films before, we went back down to the car to get the rest of the sleeping bags and that kind of stuff. But what happened is, I actually went down first. I kind of bushwhacked a little bit, you guys know how I like that, and then I hooked up with a trail later, and I was just, oh, I don't know, probably 50 yards ahead of him. And as I'm walking down, I'm almost to the street, and I notice a car was parked on the street right where our cars were parked, and it was just sitting there. I'm thinking, what is that car doing? As I walk and I come around this tree, I look over and there's a nice big old bull moose. And he's, well, he's not huge, but he's sitting there and he sees me come around the corner, he stops and he looks at me. And then my brother-in-law, Uncle Bingo, starts coming behind me, and I tell him to kind of be quiet because I want to get some film of this guy, and I kind of wave him over. But one thing I always talk about is looking for body language, and you're going to see it in this one. One of the signs of aggression that moose exhibit when you are in their space is they will often lower their heads, their ears will lay back on their heads. And then this guy, he started a beeline right at me. Now, what to look for here is, the first thing I did when I saw him, I thought, yeah, we're kind of close, but I'll be honest, you get a camera in my hand and all I'm thinking about is getting a shot. So I get my camera out, and when he starts coming at me, I'll edit this so it's kid-friendly. But I actually switched the camera to my left hand so that I could get my Glock 27 out of my ribs pack with my right, but it was just very sloppy because I'm trying to film him and I'm trying to get my gun out and I'm trying to watch him all at the same time. And anyway, I'll have you take a look at this, it's kind of fun. So of course, this is when I first see him. I get the camera right out of the pack. He hasn't seen me yet, but then he turns right here, bam, he sees me. Now it doesn't take him long, lower his head, see him lower his ears. Now, at this point, for some reason, I go into a weird accent and I'm trying to fish my Glock 27 out. Although I do have some good footage of you. Not really because it's so shaky. I think we're just kind of right in his way, there he goes, he's alright. Now what ensues here is me and Uncle Bingo just really enjoying the experience and talking about it, and it's very raw footage guys, it's just kind of a snapshot of this trip and a very unpolished snapshot of that. Is there two of them? Oh yeah, there is. Is it a bull or is it a cow? The thing is, is we're getting into rut season. And that means they get pretty ornery. Not quite though, but close. Looks like they're just doing their thing, I love this man, jeez. Good thing you stopped me, I came charging down the trail, making all kinds of sounds to scare bears, but. Uncle Bingo of course. You would have just took me out. I mean the cars are just right there, that's where the road is. And the bull moose and what we think is a cow. And we're pretty dang close to that bull moose right now. Let's see if I can... He's just right there, he's watching us. He's okay. He's alright. They really blend in if you're not watching. Yeah, they do don't they? As big as they are. Okay, this is what we're going to do. I'm going to film you. You run up, slap his butt, or spray paint it, and run as fast as you can. I'll tape the whole thing, this will be great YouTube footage. This will be like missing the Sasquatch a little bit. Okay, I'm in. Okay. We just forced him in the brush. Now see, I can't tell if he's eating or maybe... Look at this, maybe this is his bed. He's like, hey buddy. Get away from my bed. This is about as close as I dare get. We're probably 20 feet apart with a lot of brush in between us. He seems pretty calm. He's just gone about his business eating again. That's one thing I do, is really watch their body language. And understand where you are too. I know a lot of you guys tell me... I've had several guys in Alaska tell me, you could never do this. In Alaska with the moose that they have. Sorry guys, I'm not filming too well right now. I'm more watching him than trying to film him. Hey look, there's a baby. Awesome. Put him in your pack. What? Got straight up mauled by a cougar. Got on a buffalo. Buffalo sounds. We're approaching moose territory again. And this is our strategy. We've got plenty of sleeping bags. So if he charges us, we use the sleeping bag as a shield, punch him, wrestle him down, hog tie him. Good to go. I could do a drop kick to knock him over. That would be cool. We need to set up the camera though, so we can get it all on tape. Where's your action camera? Do you see that one? The bear one? That's freaking hilarious. He's right there, hanging out.

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: Guernsey County. Thanks for watching!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The cats' efforts were captured by high-definition and slow-motion cameras for the Saving a Species series for teachers.Subscribe to our channel on YouTube:  to our print magazine:  our Blog:  us on Twitter:  a fan on Facebook:  our TV show: \nTranscript: Today we're shooting an episode of Shamu TV. It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection. It's just something that we've been doing for a long time. We're very passionate about our care for animals and we want to share that with everyone.\nComment: This is exactly what I came here for, to hear how well the cheetah adapted to the lights and new environment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: This beautiful video made me cry. At first I was crying because of the horrible cruelty and exploitation that these beautiful cats have experienced, but then I started crying tears of joy that Flavio (and all of the other critters that are in your care) finally gets to experience the beauty and happiness that they deserve. Although it is sad that Flavio isn't here on earth with us anymore, it is so very comforting that he got to spend his \"retirement years\" in a place where people loved and cared for him and made his life so enriching and happy. You can see the joy in his eyes when he is running around and playing, like he finally was able to be a tiger. I am so grateful that there are people like those at Big Cat Rescue who dedicate their time and lives to give these extraordinary animals the happiness and respect that they deserve."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The Coyote Pack is growing. We just hit 50,000 subscribers and it's all because of you. Yes, you, the audience. Keep sharing the videos because the bigger we get, the bigger the adventures get. Stick around, Question of the Week is coming up next. Welcome back. In case you guys missed last week's Behind the Adventure, make sure you check it out. There's still the chance to win those awesome SOG adventure tools. I got some great questions this past week. The one that really stood out came in from Ray Wong. Ray asks, hey Coyote and the crew, I've been wondering how the Coyote Pack is going to grow in the future. How are we going to make it grow in the future? I'm going to tell you how we're going to make it grow. We're going to make it grow in the future. I've been wondering, how long does it take for you guys to produce one of your typical 10 minute episodes? That's a really great question, Ray. And it's tough to answer that one directly because each episode is different. So the crew and I got together and we talked about this and we kind of came upon the number of 48 collective working hours to make one of the 10 minute episodes that you see every single week. And it's different based on animal and location. But there's three different parts that goes into every single episode. Pre-production, production, and post-production. First, let's talk about the pre-production. And it starts with the internet and with field guides. I do a ton of research about the animals that I might want to encounter. And then I start researching the locations that we can travel to to ultimately encounter these animals. Once I figure out what animal it is we want to go after, we start booking our trip and then production begins. Once we actually get on the ground in a location, it can take us days sometimes to find some of these animals. So it's me, it's Mark, it's Chance, it's Melissa, it's my wildlife biologist Mario, and we'll be out there three, four, five days trying to encounter as many animals as we can. So let's say we're in Arizona, we've put together a list of 15 different animals that we want to encounter. We're not gonna see all 15 of these animals. We might see five of those animals and then we might see four or five that we didn't plan on seeing. I've gotta be ready for any situation and any animal at any point in time, which makes it challenging. Once we're there in the environment, and let's say it's a rattlesnake, and we've encountered the rattlesnake and I've caught the rattlesnake, the catch is obviously the most dangerous part. Once I've got the animal in my hands and under control, the camera team can move in close and we begin filming the presentation segment. After we get all of the footage that we needed in the field, then it goes in to post-production. This is a whole different ballgame. This is where you actually put together the puzzle. Now when we come back from a trip, we have anywhere between, I don't know, maybe 40 and 50 hours worth of footage. Think about that, 40 or 50 hours worth of footage that breaks down into these little seven to 10 minute segments. We begin sifting through all of it, finding the best shots, finding the takes that I don't mess up on, and piecing them together. Then comes the sound effects, then comes the music, then comes the color correction, and ultimately, we have a finished episode that we get to upload to YouTube for everyone out there to enjoy. So again, I'd say in total, to put together one of our typical 10 minute episodes, it probably takes about 48 working hours. That was a fantastic question, Ray. Keep writing in every single week. I'll be out here in the field answering your questions. I'm Coyote Peterson. Be brave, stay wild. We'll see you next week. So for me, this is gonna be one heck of an experience. Even though it's a bear that's been raised in captivity for educational purposes, he's an ambassador for his species, it is still a grizzly bear and deserves an incredible amount of respect. I can see it right over my shoulder here and it is big. You're gonna come hiking through this game trail here across this pass. Have a camera down there getting that perspective. Adam will be coming back from that game trail leading to the bushes. There's good cover there, so we can have somebody back there with him. He's gonna come out as you're passing by and he's gonna startle you and you're gonna turn around and you're gonna do what you're supposed to do.\nComment: i dont know how i got here but since i seen your videos i cant stop seeing them ,i saw all of the videos qnd i love all your videos, u should have a tv show , i will be sharing your videos"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Hare sheep is what they are, get away from rabbits for a little bit. Anyway, these are the hare sheep, here comes Shelby, she's an Anatolian Marema Lifestyle Guardian dog and she's just a little bit over a year old. She keeps the sheep safe in here, come here Shelby, come here girl, good girl. We used to lose sheep to the coyotes out here and ever since we got her, come here Shelby, come girl, she's really kept an eye out on them. It's real fun to watch her because right about 4 in the afternoon when it starts getting dark, she'll go ahead and walk the fence line. She's definitely keeping the coyotes out, they had multiple holes along the fence line. It's about 5 acres in here and it's mostly all blackberry. All this right here that's all cleared out used to look like what's over there on the other side of the fence, sheep can't get to that so that's all overgrown. That's what it looked like and this is what it looks like over here now and they still have a lot to go. Right now, they're eating some hay, some orchard grass and these hare sheep, there's a few different breeds in here and I'll go through them here. This one here that's looking back at us, she's a Catan-Dorper cross and there's a few of those. Most of all the white ones are Catan-Dorper and that guy right there in the middle, he's a breeding ram, that white one and that's one of the breeding rams and the one right next to him that's got the little horns there, he just moved, he's another breeding ram. We keep two in here and that one that just poked her head out, she's a Dorper-Barbados black belly cross and this orange one here, she's a Catan. She's an orange Catan and the breeding ram, he's a white Catan and this little one that looks like deer with the black belly, they are the purebred American Barbados black belly and that one there with the black head, she's a Blackhead-Dorper. There's two of those and they're registered and papered and everything and this little guy here in the front, little red guy there, he is a Barbados cross. We don't know what his sire was, the previous ram that we had in here, he was sired by that one and we don't know what he was anyway. He's a pretty looking, he's a weather and these two rams here, they're unrelated to all of these ewes and most of all these ewes were born in December of last year or so they're about 11 months old so they're all coming into heat now and we'll probably have some spring lambs in March so I'll probably do a video of them so look forward to that. There's two black ones in the back or the dark colored ones back there, there's two of them, they're sisters. I don't know if I can get a good shot from this side of the fence but they're Columbian Shetland cross, there she is, poked her head right in the middle of those and hair sheep you don't need to shear them, doctor tails or trim their hooves, they're very low maintenance, they're good for brush eating, for pets and for meat as well. They're gaining a lot of popularity out here in the northwest, they're very popular out in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, parts of California, Mexico and Central America and South America and down south of Mexico they call them the Pelebues, so they're nice animals to keep, they're very lean, mild taste and they are nowhere near as stinky as goats and they have very good mothering instincts, so they're easy keepers these guys, that's why we like them. Some of these have their tails docked just for the look really, usually you want to dock the tails on wool sheep because of the maggots get stuck back there, causes the animal to get sick and then die, but because these animals have hair, it's not like a horse or a cow or a dog, it's not going to get stuck back there in the wool, but we do it just for the look, I think they look nice with their tails docked, they've really done a good job of clearing this up out here. There's another breed of hair sheep, they're called St. Croix, they're from the island of St. Thomas and they're even more parasite resistant, they don't get to be as meaty, they're still pretty nice animals. And then there's a few other hair sheep, I forget what the names of the breeds are. That's the video, hope you guys enjoyed it, if you have any questions or comments, post them up, and if you haven't subscribed, subscribe, you're welcome to, and we'll catch you next time.\nComment: Thanks for a very informative video. I'm looking for a new pet to go with my horses and chickens. These hair sheep seem like a great choice. Thanks for sharing."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: @DLegato There's no reliable evidence of a black tiger ever existing, there have been reports.

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: Poachers have also taken to seeking out and disabling camera traps. One survey group found over 80% of their cameras had been stolen or smashed. I'm sure that's not uncommon. So the next technological advancement needs to be instant satellite upload connected to facial recognition software to identify and catch poachers regardless of whether they destroy the camera."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

In this highlight, Forsberg describes his mission to catch a bobcat with a camera trap in Nebraska.-----A nature photographer and Nebraska native, Michael Forsberg shares his work documenting this vast landscape, its lakes, prairies along with its plants and animals.The Great Plains are a dynamic but often forgotten landscape -- overlooked, undervalued, misunderstood, and in desperate need of conservation. Forsberg's book helps lead the way forward, informing and inspiring readers to recognize the wild spirit and splendor of this irreplaceable part of the planet. - California Academy of SciencesMichael Forsberg is a Nebraska native and has focused much of his work in North America's Great Plains, once one of the greatest grassland ecosystems on Earth. His goal has been to try to capture the wild spirit that still survives in these wide-open spaces and put a face to the often overlooked native creatures and landscapes found there. His hope is that the images can build appreciation and go to work to inspire conservation efforts on the land far into the future.Forsberg received a degree in geography with an emphasis in environmental studies from the University of Nebraska, and worked briefly as a seasonal ranger in the National Park Service before accepting a job as a staff photographer and writer producing natural history stories for NEBRASKAland Magazine, the state's conservation publication. He worked at the magazine for six years before starting his own photography business and gallery.Forsberg's work has appeared in publications including Audubon, National Geographic, National Wildlife, and Natural History, and recognized in the Pictures of the Year and Wildlife Photographer of the Year competitions. In 2001, his image of a Nebraska tallgrass prairie was selected for an International Postage Stamp. In 2004, he was awarded a Conservation Education Award from The Wildlife Society. Recently, he was featured in the PBS documentary \"Crane Song,\" and was the 2009 recipient of the North American Nature Photographer's Association Mission Award.\nTranscript: For a TV, the world is thinking. For these four years, I tried to photograph predators like wolves, grizzly bears, mountain lions, bison, all these creatures that still just barely exist in certain areas of their range. And we were successful on all those except for a bobcat. So when the field work was all done, I went back home and we had about three or four months to get the book out the door. And somebody called me from a little prairie outside of my hometown in Lincoln, Nebraska and said, we think we've seen a bobcat. You can try to photograph your bobcat here. So what the heck? So I went out and I put this camera trap up along this game trail. Here's the camera in a waterproof housing. Right here is a transmitter and a receiver where an infrared beam is going across this game trail. And here's a little flash. And here's a little flash right here. So if something walks down here and steps over that log, in theory the camera should take a picture, right? For the first two months, this is what I got. Nothing. I don't know if it was the prairie fairies or if it was my friends playing tricks on me or what, but we didn't get any pictures of anything other than just nothing. And then, finally, after the turn of the year, we started to get photographs. Raccoon first. Bunny rabbit. Farmer Jones cat down the road. Farmer Jones dog down the road. Good job, California. I got a call in early March 2009 from my publisher, and they said, Mike, you got to pull the plug. Book's got to go off to print. You're done. I went out to pick up the camera traps. I had two pictures in the last deal. Here's the first one. And then an hour later, and it was really great to end with that photograph because that's the last picture that was made for this book. And it sort of creates the arc in the story for me because the look in that bobcat's eye is that same look that I saw in that burrowing owl's eye maybe 10 years earlier. The other thing was was that after traveling and being gone away from my family for all that time, I took this photograph 15 minutes from my home in a prairie that's been restored.\nComment: funny how they are all looking at the camera"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned.

Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels.

Because Dawn is tough enough to cut through grease, even natural disaster-type grease, while being gentle enough to clean the delicate skins of these animals, as you can see in our national TV commercial. Wildlife rescue workers open up a lot of Dawn, tough on grease, yet gentle. Dawn helps open something even bigger. This year, Dawn is also donating $1 million. Learn more at Dawn Saves Wildlife. The centerpiece of our effort was a nine-part documentary series, The Big Picture, shown only online. The series showed the everyday threats to wildlife and explained what people could do about it. The Big Picture could be seen on dawnsaveswildlife.com and YouTube. Pelicans are one of California's big success stories. They just came off the endangered species list in 2009. They're thriving despite all of these issues that they're still having to deal with. Pelicans are prehistoric creatures. This is an animal that's evolved over time and is specific for plunge-feeding fish. When people feed them, they stop doing what they do naturally and start looking in the dumpsters. What happens with that is they become dirty. The biggest problem that it causes is it contaminates their feathers. And that ability to be waterproof, it can make them hypothetical. At the end of the day, they have to be cleaned. We have the product that does it, and it works better than anything. Dawn. Paid media drove people to the micro-site.

Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five. I'm Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism.\nComment: at least hunt something you can eat! you who hunt for sport are not better than wild beasts!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

How do you know? It hasn't moved. That's real. Let's get away from here. What are you so afraid of? It could turn around and come right up here. What are you kidding? It's just a little one. I don't care how little it is. It could only bite your foot. Little ones don't eat? It could only lose a toe. Do you think that's real? Yeah. So did we see a crocodile or an alligator? It wasn't out. I didn't know there was a whale. It's got a strap. For photos, on the second half of the tour of that bird, they're going to be standing right next to you. Okay? I've never been in any place where you could get this close to great blue herons, and I've never seen... The wildlife in the Everglades don't play by the rules, because water is life. Whatever God gives us for that amount of water of the year, they have. Whether you're dangerous or not, we don't want to appear dangerous. This is a mother alligator. How many people are seeing an alligator in the wild for the first time today? Okay. I've got three questions for you, and we're going to have a quiz at the top. What color are alligators? I didn't ask you. You better tell me later. Oh, see, she's tired of me already. Oh, she's okay. Oh, she's big enough to be a monitor. They start off maybe four or five feet long. Yeah, the babies are on the grass behind the mothers. I think that might be a baby gator. The baby gators are on the grass behind you? Yeah. Are you a mama? Well, obviously that has to be a female. Well, if it was a male, there weren't any babies in there. They'd be in his tummy. Well, I can tell you how you wouldn't need to find out for sure if you wanted to want to. Anyway, mama and one little baby on the pipe. Oh, there's two babies. They're like right across from each other. It's like stereo babies. Stereo baby gators. Very relaxed because we've had a long, very hot, very dry rainy season. And the other years we were very stressed out. Yep, it's the babies. Two of them. All right, now let's turn it up. The babies are quiet. See? The babies are quiet. She's backing up three babies. We're just going to roll them by real slow. She's not real happy. See how protected she is? Unlike most reptiles, turtles or whatever that lay their eggs and then go back in the water. That's in a motherhood. Now a gator is more like a panther in the way the female protects her babies. And she will protect her babies not only from birds and otters or whatever is coming after them. She will have to protect her babies from turtles. Come back. Relax. We're at the tower here at Shark Island. I'm going to zoom in. Just laying on the grass there. Yeah. Is this another little one over here? Yeah. Push it. Is that another little one right here? That thing's a monster. It's crazy. Push it. Okay, we're heading to the tower at Shark Island. We just saw a whole bunch of alligators. Probably about six. And they were mothers with babies. And we're just walking to the tower right now. The tower is right there. We're going to be standing at the top there and looking around. You can see around 360 degrees. Are you going to make it? Yeah. I think she'll make it. I haven't got shoes on. Just get her good shoes on. We're walking up this circular path and you can see it goes all the way around to the tower. There's frickin' alligators everywhere. You notice here? That's the only remains of the guy that fell off this bridge. Just his hat. And there's the gator. There's the gator that ate the guy.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over.

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: Very nice, very informative, sure wish more people cared and understood, once it's gone, it's gone for ever!

I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: Absolutely! And according to the evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond they are \"the most intriguingly human of birds\". Truly fascinating birds! "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

These forests are home to diverse fauna and flora, many of them showing affinities to the Malayan region, but are increasingly threatened by human activity. Several national parks and other protected areas lie within the range, but it is estimated that only a small fraction of the Western Ghats remains in pristine condition. The Silent Valley National Park in Kerala is considered by many to be the last tracts of virgin tropical evergreen forest in India.Biogeographers have long recognized the distinctive plant and animal communities of the Western Ghats. Many of these faunal and floral elements are not found anywhere else in India except in parts of northeastern India. The Western Ghats are also home to many endemic species, and the endemism is especially high in the amphibian and reptilian fauna.\nTranscript: so so so so so ah uh so hmm so so so so so so so\nComment: wow so I love my india India.....\n\n\nindia"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: I miss my pet rat, sir Da Vinci, it blew my mind how intelligent rats actually can be, they are also very affectionate pets.

It is so gorgeous. Look at that skyline. Oh, look at these two! Oh, hello lionesses! What are you looking for? Some scraps for your family? Oh, this lioness totally knows it's hunting time. Hi, cutie. As the sun is out and about in Africa, so are the animals. Now look at these zeebees. They're ultra-affectionate. That's right, zebras want rubs too, you know. Look, this one's going at it with the tree. This wildebeest is like, give me a break. You zebras have a lot to learn, please. Cut the affection. It's time to live and survive. What are you, cray-cray? Come on, move it! Those lionesses are going to eat your ass! Wildebeest is Dutch for wild beast or wild cattle, and they're more or less like antelope. They're like the antelope of Africa in certain parts, and they can live up to 40 years. Amazing. Oh, look at this beauty. This is a grey-crowned crane. What a gorgeous headdress. The grey-crowned cranes are also found in Africa, and they have such a startling call. If you heard it, you would poop yourself, I'm telling you. Now look, look at these Congo peafowls. Congo peafowls, or Congo peacocks, are splendid. They have those blue heads, and they're the national bird of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And they dwell mostly by the river basin. Now look, this cheetah's like, holy shit, and I thought I was fast. Those peafowls move like lightning, says this cheetah. Across the way, over by the water, there are just so many wonderful birds of Africa. They're all just chilling. Look at this. Look at these schools of birds just flying around, doing their thing, mostly trying to get fish out of the water. And as you can see, these are great, there are some great white pelicans here. And the great white pelicans have a wingspan of 7 to 11 feet. What the fuck? That is crazy. That's like a bumming 757. Now look at these black, these are African black ducks. They're very shy, yet territorial. Now look at this pelican, getting all primpy. And these are brown peafowls, just doing a little head dance in the water, waiting for fish. African black ducks, great white pelicans, all these birds just chilling, waiting for a chance to eat. Now what's nasty about the great white pelican is that they, while they mainly eat fish, they've been known to eat chicks and smaller birds. That is so nasty. Look at those legs. I can't believe how they're able to do that with their toes.

The rut continues right here on Bowhunt or Die!\nTranscript: Bowhunter Dye is being brought to you by Matthews, Lost Camo, New Archery Products, J.B. Tinks, Lone Wolf Portable Tree Stands, Scent Blocker, Campbell Cameras, and Stealth Cam. Welcome to another action-packed episode of Bowhunter Dye. I'm Justin Zarr and alongside me as always is Todd Graff. You know, Todd, we've got two more really exciting buck hunts to share with our audience this week. We do. You know, it's been a great year. I've been fortunate enough to harvest my second buck here in Illinois. It's a buck's name is Captain Hook. It turned out to be quite the adventure on the recovery but it did work out okay in the end. Yeah, you know, I actually got to play a little part in that recovery but, you know, last week we talked about backing out after an unsure hit which is what you did and actually the other buck that we're going to feature this week which came from Dean Krieger, kind of the same scenario. He was a little bit unsure of the hit so he backed out and, you know, fortunately was able to recover his buck the next day. Right, you know, it's difficult to pull out. It makes really for a sick sleeping evening but in the end it is the smartest thing to do. Well, let's jump right in a tree with Todd on his hunt for Captain Hook. Beautiful buck. I don't know if he went down over there or not, guys. I made a nice Tony Vineyard shot. It looked to me to be a good shot. Oh, he popped right out of this corn. Scared those two smaller bucks away. I'm gonna have to re-watch the footage. I don't know how good of a shot I made or didn't make. I mean, it looked like it wasn't bad but he just didn't act the way I wanted him to act. I may have only got one lung. Let's get out of here. I've learned from experience when you find yourself in situations you just gotta back out, be calm, don't disturb the area. Hopefully he will not go far and he'll expire. Well, the Calvary has arrived. Mike and Justin just showed up. They're not hunting that far away from here so luckily they were able to come give me a hand. You know, that buck came in and I blew it. There's no question about it. I could have been a little bit more calm and I shouldn't have punched the trigger like the way I did. That buck was totally calm. I should have just gave him two more steps and I would have probably had a much better broadside double lung shot but you know what? We did all the stuff right. We pulled out. It's been over four and a half hours now so we're gonna go over at the point of impact, see if we can find my arrow. I'm pretty positive it was a pass through. We've watched the footage over and over and over. He went about 30-40 yards and just stood there for a while so let's see what we can find. I'm hoping that this buck didn't go too far. Let's take a look. We got some blood right here guys. I mean there hasn't been a lot of blood but we're still on the trail so that definitely makes me feel better. We just jumped him. That's not a good sign. That's enough to make you sick right there guys. Wait until tomorrow on this one. I'm here with my friend Scott Hill. He's my neighbor. You know what? It's so great when you got good neighbors when you own hunting property. There's nothing better and more valuable than a good neighbor. Scott was nice enough to, actually he was super nice. He left his wife go hunting this morning and he came out here and helped me track. You know, he went about another 100 yards. We found about four more beds. We just came up around the hill over here and there he is. He's laying right over there. He must have just went up the hill and then came back down. Oh my gosh guys. What an awesome looking deer. Come on take a look at this buck. It's November 7th. You know what? I found my buck, thank goodness, this morning. I shot him yesterday morning. I had great footage. You know, the buck came right in. Unfortunately, I made a mistake. I should have gave that buck at least a couple more seconds and he probably would have turned broadside to me. He's a good four and a half year old. Nice brown horns, heavy mass. He's got this really unique right side. There's nothing better than shooting a freak buck. I can't wait to check my stealth cams out. I'm hoping I got a couple videos up because this is really a good looking buck. He's just a good heavy horn. Nice looking buck. I am extremely happy. I am tagged out in Illinois. I'm going to head now to Wisconsin. I've got two tags left in Wisconsin. I'm going to head up there and see what I can get done in Wisconsin. It's been three years since I put one down up there.\nComment: I've hunted So. Illinois 2 years in a row now and I have yet to see a buck even close to that size.

They suspect that poachers killed their mother for her pelt. At first, everyone thinks they're leopard cubs. It turns out they're the rarest of finds. Two clouded leopard cubs. The find captures the imagination of top Indian wildlife photographer Sandesh Kadur. Cats have always fascinated me, and when I heard about these clouded leopards being rehabilitated back into the wild, I dropped everything and rushed to the spot to document the whole process. In terms of filming a new species of cat, I mean, this was it. This is the holy grail. Clouded leopards are amazing creatures, the smallest of the big cats. Shy and elusive, even cat specialists know little about their habits in the wild. Just keeping them alive is a big challenge. A leading vet, Dr. Bhaskar Chowdhury, takes charge of caring for these very special cubs. That was the first experience for me to see wild clouded leopard cubs for the first time in my life. So I was really excited and also a bit nervous because the onus is on us, the veterinarians, to make them survive. Bhaskar is determined that the cubs don't end up in the zoo like most orphaned big cats. He gets permission to try something totally unprecedented, to teach clouded leopard cubs how to be wild. It's totally new, never been tried, never been tested, and people, you know, many scientists won't believe this. It's a huge gamble. If his new protocol succeeds, it will boost dwindling numbers of clouded leopards in their real home, the forest. If they get it wrong, the cubs will die.\nComment: There so cute,they need to protect in the future."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}

The 800,000-acre Twin Peaks Herd Management Area lies along the California-Nevada border northeast of Susanville.\nTranscript: Hi, I'm standing in the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area in Northern California. This is the largest wild horse and burrow management area in BLM California. This summer we're planning a gather to bring in excess horses and burrows because we have too many on the range right now and it's not healthy for either the horses, the burrows or the range that they live on. We manage for a lot of uses out here. Horses and burrows are one of them, as well as cattle and public recreation. So it's important to make sure that we balance all of these uses and make sure that we're taking care of the land we're charged to manage. Today we're going to take you around and show you some of the herd management area. We'll show you some of the areas where the horses and the burrows like to live, where they range, what they eat. We might even be able to see horses and burrows today, that's our plan. Straddling the Nevada-California border about 120 miles north of Reno, Nevada, this rugged high desert landscape provides important habitat for wild horses and burrows and wildlife. It also provides forage for domestic livestock grazing that is an important part of local economies. The appropriate management level for the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area is 448 to 758 wild horses and 72 to 116 wild burrows. The current populations are estimated at 2,300 wild horses, about five times the appropriate management level, and 280 wild burrows, about two times the appropriate management level. At almost 800,000 acres, the region is vast, but its resources limited. In fact, many parts of this rugged-looking landscape are fragile and require careful management. We're standing here on the edge of the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area. I wanted to show you the perennial grasses that are out here and explain a little bit as to why they're important. So before me is some crested wheatgrass and you'll see that it's critical. It's good forage for wild horses and burrows. It also serves as thermal cover for a lot of the smaller species that we have, birds and lizards and things like that. It serves also a purpose of keeping the soil in place. It helps to bind the soil particles together through the root system and also shield the soil particles from raindrop impact. In this part of the HMA, things are higher in elevation, so we end up with more production. These perennial grasses that you see behind me are plentiful and can provide more forage per acre, whereas other parts of the HMA are lower elevation and you end up with approximately 30 acres per one horse a month. We'll show you that a little later when we get to one of those spots. So here we are in the lower elevation area of the Twin Peaks HMA, and while it certainly is beautiful, looks can be deceiving. This area here would take about 30 football fields, or 30 acres, to support one horse per month. It comes out to be a lot of country when you consider we want about 500 horses in the HMA. There are other uses out here as well, such as pronghorn, mule deer, and permitted livestock grazing. The horses and burros are healthy, and much of the range appears to be healthy as well. A closer look, however, reveals that some areas are showing signs of stress, requiring management actions, including reducing the wild horse herd. Limited water and the need to keep water sources healthy are the primary management concerns in Twin Peaks. So we're at Painter Creek now, and this is an area that we would call functioning at risk during our riparian assessments. Some of the indicators here as to why things are not properly functioning. You can see the slough banks here. This is due to trampling from livestock and horses when they come down in. If the right type of riparian vegetation isn't here, and the root system isn't stable enough to hold the soil in place, you'll actually get it sloughing off, destabilizing the banks, and then also causing a decrease in water quality. So there are several reasons why we want to keep riparian areas from becoming this degraded, and why we want to see them in proper functioning condition and not functioning at risk. That includes for the health of the wildlife that use the area, as well as the health of the Twin Peaks horse herd. It's important to keep this water system available and functioning year-round, since water is such a limiting factor in these arid environments. So this is an example of a properly functioning riparian area. Some of the indicators that you would look for would be riparian species covering the banks, which is what you see here, aquatic vegetation throughout the stream channel, clear water that can support wildlife, such as the fish and the minnows that you see in the creek behind us, as well as stabilized makes. Visited during spring, much of the Twin Peaks area appears vibrant and green, but this situation changes over the course of the summer. Hot weather and the lack of rain reduce the amount of forage available for range animals, including wild horses and burros. To keep ranges healthy, the BLM must balance uses at sustainable levels. Livestock are managed in specific areas and allowed on the range for designated grazing seasons. In response to resource conditions, the BLM and ranchers have reduced livestock numbers by about 50% compared to 30 years ago. Wild horses and burros use the range all year, therefore, herd populations must be maintained at sustainable levels. Balancing uses is part of the BLM's multiple-use mandate and responsibility on the public lands. Wild horses are an integral part and an important part of that diversity that's found out on the ranges. However, if their numbers are allowed to increase without management, then eventually it will come to damage not only the resources and the other uses on the ranges, but the wild horses themselves. Twin Peaks has always had the ability to carry some horses. When numbers get very, very high, you can really run into problems. What in effect happens is that more animals end up being at risk and there can be a set up for catastrophic losses, either from a long-term drought or heavy snow. You know, we're proud of the fact that we have healthy wild horses and burros on the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area. It's important to us to be proactive and make sure that we keep the horses and burros within an appropriate management level. Therefore, we come out and every few years we have to remove the excess horses and burros, and that helps us ensure that the horses and burros remain healthy, as well as the rangelands that they like to roam on. The wild horses and burros that we remove off the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area all go to good homes. Some of them are adopted out, they're very popular for their size and their health, and some of them go to long-term pastures. It's important to BLM that these wild horses and burros do end up in good homes or in the long-term pastures where they can spend the rest of their lives. As public land managers, our job is to manage wild horses and burros on the range, to keep both the horses and burros healthy, as well as the rangelands. And we welcome and encourage your involvement in that work. It takes all of us together to make sure that we're doing the right thing by the horses and the burros and the land.\nComment: Totally agree 'conwayhorse lover\" A bit insane that they then expect us to trust them.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: More people need to see this. People with power to change opinions. "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Hare sheep is what they are, get away from rabbits for a little bit. Anyway, these are the hare sheep, here comes Shelby, she's an Anatolian Marema Lifestyle Guardian dog and she's just a little bit over a year old. She keeps the sheep safe in here, come here Shelby, come here girl, good girl. We used to lose sheep to the coyotes out here and ever since we got her, come here Shelby, come girl, she's really kept an eye out on them. It's real fun to watch her because right about 4 in the afternoon when it starts getting dark, she'll go ahead and walk the fence line. She's definitely keeping the coyotes out, they had multiple holes along the fence line. It's about 5 acres in here and it's mostly all blackberry. All this right here that's all cleared out used to look like what's over there on the other side of the fence, sheep can't get to that so that's all overgrown. That's what it looked like and this is what it looks like over here now and they still have a lot to go. Right now, they're eating some hay, some orchard grass and these hare sheep, there's a few different breeds in here and I'll go through them here. This one here that's looking back at us, she's a Catan-Dorper cross and there's a few of those. Most of all the white ones are Catan-Dorper and that guy right there in the middle, he's a breeding ram, that white one and that's one of the breeding rams and the one right next to him that's got the little horns there, he just moved, he's another breeding ram. We keep two in here and that one that just poked her head out, she's a Dorper-Barbados black belly cross and this orange one here, she's a Catan. She's an orange Catan and the breeding ram, he's a white Catan and this little one that looks like deer with the black belly, they are the purebred American Barbados black belly and that one there with the black head, she's a Blackhead-Dorper. There's two of those and they're registered and papered and everything and this little guy here in the front, little red guy there, he is a Barbados cross. We don't know what his sire was, the previous ram that we had in here, he was sired by that one and we don't know what he was anyway. He's a pretty looking, he's a weather and these two rams here, they're unrelated to all of these ewes and most of all these ewes were born in December of last year or so they're about 11 months old so they're all coming into heat now and we'll probably have some spring lambs in March so I'll probably do a video of them so look forward to that. There's two black ones in the back or the dark colored ones back there, there's two of them, they're sisters. I don't know if I can get a good shot from this side of the fence but they're Columbian Shetland cross, there she is, poked her head right in the middle of those and hair sheep you don't need to shear them, doctor tails or trim their hooves, they're very low maintenance, they're good for brush eating, for pets and for meat as well. They're gaining a lot of popularity out here in the northwest, they're very popular out in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, parts of California, Mexico and Central America and South America and down south of Mexico they call them the Pelebues, so they're nice animals to keep, they're very lean, mild taste and they are nowhere near as stinky as goats and they have very good mothering instincts, so they're easy keepers these guys, that's why we like them. Some of these have their tails docked just for the look really, usually you want to dock the tails on wool sheep because of the maggots get stuck back there, causes the animal to get sick and then die, but because these animals have hair, it's not like a horse or a cow or a dog, it's not going to get stuck back there in the wool, but we do it just for the look, I think they look nice with their tails docked, they've really done a good job of clearing this up out here. There's another breed of hair sheep, they're called St. Croix, they're from the island of St. Thomas and they're even more parasite resistant, they don't get to be as meaty, they're still pretty nice animals. And then there's a few other hair sheep, I forget what the names of the breeds are. That's the video, hope you guys enjoyed it, if you have any questions or comments, post them up, and if you haven't subscribed, subscribe, you're welcome to, and we'll catch you next time.\nComment: Awesome man!

While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this. We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life.

A few flags on him but I don't think they're going to worry him too much because there's no wounds. He's obviously in a bit of shock but he doesn't seem that bad. I just wonder where he came from. He must have come from this side. So I'm going to release him down here I think. You can go now. Don't get stuck in any holes.\nComment: i appreciate that you set the animals you save to the wild.

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: River Otters vs Alligators 03 Music  Otters are semi-aquatic, slender, long-bodied mammals which are specialized for capturing prey in the water. Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old. River Otters was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro / South Florida 2014.\nTranscript: ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪\nComment: very cool video brah..."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

There was a lot of blood on the ground, so the team was worried the deer might be injured.When they finally caught him, they discovered that the blood was from his hooves and not from a fresh wound.

So click subscribe to keep up to date with our new videos uploaded almost every day!\nTranscript: Good morning. We've just arrived at the school playground where there's an adult male roe deer unable to get out. There's a lot of blood on the ground, we're not sure whether it's because he's been running on the concrete or he's got an injury. Because he's down we're going to try to see if we can get to a point where we can get this little jab stick over him and get it into him because we know he'll then go to sleep very quickly. But it's not the easiest thing and they usually don't stand it, but it will save us having to try to catch him. Right, that was the end of that one. Absolutely screwed the needle. Okay, didn't work people. He's quite calm at the moment, but he could so easily jump over that fence just back and forth. Sean's got him really well contained, he's just very steady behind him keeping him calm. But we don't know where he's going to go from. Well, that was a much more sedate rescue than it might have been. The wound on his flank is very old, he's done it a long time ago. We can put a bit of gel on that and maybe give him an antibiotic. It's really old, it's healed. We just need to see where all this blood's coming from. I think the blood's from his hooves. These have bled and you can see where he's gone backwards and forwards across that end part. He's got a cut on either eye as well. That's old. This side's not quite so old. He's been in the wars a bit. He has. These are all really old injuries, they're completely dry. I've got the antlers protected so he can't do you any damage, will he? OK, I'm ready. OK, let's go on. Come on, fella. Steady. Get Lucy's expression well, Andy. No, don't. OK, we good? Well, the deer's here. Didn't have to walk very far. I'm not sure whether Lucy's ever going to walk again. She looks absolutely knackered. But he's ready to go. He's gorgeous. Straight into woodland from this field. He shouldn't go back towards the school, so he's on his own again for his second chance. We're looking at him probably as third or fourth chance, to be honest. Right, OK. And off you go, fella. Relaxed, wasn't he? He's really looking good. Just toddling off at his own pace, really. I'm in no rush. I'm back home. She's actually had five minutes to recover. But you can tell how unfit our vet nurse is, can't you? She might be good at her job. Get her to walk 200 yards and she's... Look at it. You're so naughty.

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back. There we go. There we go. Don't say I don't love you. So I hope you enjoyed your walk with Georgie and Yami.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Man saves cute baby birds | Captain Quinn How to save cute baby birds when they fall out of the nest. These baby woodpeckers fell to the ground when the rotten tree that their nest was in was pushed over. In this miraculous story of compassion, Captain Quinn saves the baby birds.\nTranscript: Captain Quinn here. Saving baby birds. Yeah, that's right. Woodpecker, to be exact. Baby woodpeckers. Flickers, to be even more specific. So about a week ago, I was building this chicken coop here, which happens to be crookeder than a witch's nose, but we won't get hung up on that. The chickens don't care. And I noticed this rotten old birch tree, and it was a complete safety hazard. So I pushed it over with my muscles, and when it hit the ground, it exploded right in the center. And I heard, squawk, squawk, squawk! And I looked, and there were seven baby woodpeckers. So I felt terrible, decided I had to do something. You know, like, they have just as much a right to be here as I do. So I gathered them all up in my warm embrace, put them in a shoebox, kept them warm in a dark place, and then did a little research, called an animal rescue helpline, and found out that I can either feed them a diluted mixture of cat food and plain yogurt every half an hour. Well, that's not going to happen. Or I can drive them the two and a half hours to the closest animal rescue shelter. That's also not going to happen. Or, their best chance at survival is to actually put them back in their nest, and put that nest back to where it originally was, so the parents can find them. You see, birds have a very poor sense of smell, but they have a very, very strong bond between the parents and the offspring, just like every other animal, which is pretty powerful, a bond that can't be broken easily. So I decided to reconstruct their nest, put them back in, hoist them back up to roughly the same spot, and see if the parents would come back. The problem was, the nest was in shatters, about 50 different pieces. But, I'm a crafty man, so I grabbed all the pieces, a few screws, hammered the screws into the old rotten tree, and duct taped around it with this clear duct tape, packing tape I think, and put the little critters back in, and tied a rope around the top of the rotten snag, and hoisted her back up, and waited. 15 minutes later, to my delight, one of the parents came back, and went right back in the little hole, and fed their little, you know, their offspring, the little babies. I've been observing these birds for about a week now, and it's pretty magnificent. About every 10 to 20 minutes, one of the parents, the mom or the dad, come back with food. They feed the little youngsters, and then they clean up the nest. They fly out, they're busy, they're at it all day. And it's been very cool getting to watch that. Pretty exciting. And they don't mind having chickens as neighbors, and they don't mind me as a spectator. So, it's been pretty cool. And it's been about a week. They've feathered up, and I check on them every day. They come over here to their home, and I, you know, I just tell them, you know, how are you guys doing? And as you can hear, they're quite little chatterboxes. There's a little hole in here I left so I could peek on them, see how they're doing. They're getting feathers. How are you guys doing? When are you planning on leaving the nest? Huh? Huh? About that time, I think. Oh, hi! I'm now, for scientific purposes, so we can get a better understanding of what exactly goes down in a woodpecker's nest, going to stick the pecker cam down inside Woody Woodpecker's hole. No, this is not a colonoscopy. See, woodpeckers, unlike other birds, have their nests inside hollow, rotten trees. I think, I'm not exactly sure what their plan is here. I don't know if they're going to peck their way out of there or climb up and jump. I'm not sure, but I'll keep you posted on that. But I just thought that, you know, if I can save a baby bird, then so can you. And sometimes, as we are being human and doing human things, we put the lives of animals at risk, and I think that we need to remember that they have a right to be here, just as much, if not more so, than us. So if we do find ourselves in a position where we have jeopardized the life of another living animal, I think we should do everything we can to save it and protect it. I'm Captain Quinn, and that's how to save a baby bird. See you next time.

Groovy! Here are 25 coolest ways that animals adapt to their environments. 25. After the rainy season, African Pixie Frogs will burrow underground and seal themselves in mucus sacks for up to seven years until it rains again. 24. If you ever happen to scare a Southern Red Muntjac Deer, be prepared for a lot of dog-like barking. 23. Cape Ground Squirrels give us all a reason to be a bit jealous as they use their tails for their own personal shade. 22. Thanks to specialized metabolisms, scorpions can go without eating for an entire year. 21. A male Sand Grouse will collect water in its feathers and take it back to the nest to share with its family. 20. The Basket Star has hidden arms and uses its tendrils to wrap around plankton and feed on them. 19. Known as Waller's Gazelle, this unique feeding posture of standing on two legs allows these creatures to reach higher branches. 18. Treehoppers have ants on their backs. Okay, it's not really an ant, but they've successfully managed to imitate one with their backside. 17. Vultures pee on themselves. As if eating rotting flesh wasn't gross enough, they actually let the pee run down their legs to cool off. 16. If you ever try picking up a Fish Hook Ant, you'll be in for a nasty surprise. It won't come off. The hook's on its back, attached to its predator. Now, imagine sticking your hand into a colony. 15. The Rhybill has a twisted beak and the bend helps it gather food. 14. The Dorca's Gazelle never needs to drink water or urinate. Although it will drink if it can, it has the capability of getting all the water it needs from its food. 13. Mario fans rejoice. The Tanooki, or Raccoon Dog, looks like a raccoon. Native to East Asia, this creature is 100% canine. No raccoon blood whatsoever. 12. Roadrunners pee from their eyeballs. While it's not urination in the same sense we're typically used to, every animal has to get rid of excess minerals somehow. Roadrunners cry them out. 11. Clown Loaches have knives below their eyes. Officially called bifurcated subocular spines, they're basically super sharp blades that the fish can shoot out from under their eyes. 10. Sicilians are worm-like amphibians that eat their mom's skin. In their defense, she will grow thicker skin to provide them with nutrients. Still pretty weird though, right? Right? Yeah, that's pretty weird. 9. The Tufted Deer has fangs and uses them primarily to fight other males for mates and territory. 8. Known as the E.T. Salamander, this little guy breathes through its skin and also has become quite famous for his ugliness. 7. Kangaroos salivate on themselves to cool down. Hey, when you don't have sweat glands, you have to make do. 6. Known as the Maned Wolf, scientists believe that it develops super long legs to see predators above the high South American grasses. 5. The short-horned lizard of North America shoots blood out of its eye as a defense mechanism and probably wins the gross prize with this one. 4. The Okapi can lick its eyeball. That's right, this horse-looking creature has a tongue so long that it uses it to clean its eyes. 3. The blotchy gray-hooded seal has what is possibly the least attractive mating ritual ever, blowing bubbles out of its nose. 2. During summer, the Addax Antelope's coat is white so as to reflect the sun, but in winter it turns brown in order to absorb the sun's rays. 1. The Osadax, also known as the zombie worm, doesn't have a mouth. Rather, it secretes acid onto the food to dissolve it and then sucks it through its skin. Enjoying our lists?

They suspect that poachers killed their mother for her pelt. At first, everyone thinks they're leopard cubs. It turns out they're the rarest of finds. Two clouded leopard cubs. The find captures the imagination of top Indian wildlife photographer Sandesh Kadur. Cats have always fascinated me, and when I heard about these clouded leopards being rehabilitated back into the wild, I dropped everything and rushed to the spot to document the whole process. In terms of filming a new species of cat, I mean, this was it. This is the holy grail. Clouded leopards are amazing creatures, the smallest of the big cats. Shy and elusive, even cat specialists know little about their habits in the wild. Just keeping them alive is a big challenge. A leading vet, Dr. Bhaskar Chowdhury, takes charge of caring for these very special cubs. That was the first experience for me to see wild clouded leopard cubs for the first time in my life. So I was really excited and also a bit nervous because the onus is on us, the veterinarians, to make them survive. Bhaskar is determined that the cubs don't end up in the zoo like most orphaned big cats. He gets permission to try something totally unprecedented, to teach clouded leopard cubs how to be wild. It's totally new, never been tried, never been tested, and people, you know, many scientists won't believe this. It's a huge gamble. If his new protocol succeeds, it will boost dwindling numbers of clouded leopards in their real home, the forest. If they get it wrong, the cubs will die.\nComment: anyone else have their cat on their laps as they watch this? lol"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

In this highlight, Forsberg describes his mission to catch a bobcat with a camera trap in Nebraska.-----A nature photographer and Nebraska native, Michael Forsberg shares his work documenting this vast landscape, its lakes, prairies along with its plants and animals.The Great Plains are a dynamic but often forgotten landscape -- overlooked, undervalued, misunderstood, and in desperate need of conservation. Forsberg's book helps lead the way forward, informing and inspiring readers to recognize the wild spirit and splendor of this irreplaceable part of the planet. - California Academy of SciencesMichael Forsberg is a Nebraska native and has focused much of his work in North America's Great Plains, once one of the greatest grassland ecosystems on Earth. His goal has been to try to capture the wild spirit that still survives in these wide-open spaces and put a face to the often overlooked native creatures and landscapes found there. His hope is that the images can build appreciation and go to work to inspire conservation efforts on the land far into the future.Forsberg received a degree in geography with an emphasis in environmental studies from the University of Nebraska, and worked briefly as a seasonal ranger in the National Park Service before accepting a job as a staff photographer and writer producing natural history stories for NEBRASKAland Magazine, the state's conservation publication. He worked at the magazine for six years before starting his own photography business and gallery.Forsberg's work has appeared in publications including Audubon, National Geographic, National Wildlife, and Natural History, and recognized in the Pictures of the Year and Wildlife Photographer of the Year competitions. In 2001, his image of a Nebraska tallgrass prairie was selected for an International Postage Stamp. In 2004, he was awarded a Conservation Education Award from The Wildlife Society. Recently, he was featured in the PBS documentary \"Crane Song,\" and was the 2009 recipient of the North American Nature Photographer's Association Mission Award.\nTranscript: For a TV, the world is thinking. For these four years, I tried to photograph predators like wolves, grizzly bears, mountain lions, bison, all these creatures that still just barely exist in certain areas of their range. And we were successful on all those except for a bobcat. So when the field work was all done, I went back home and we had about three or four months to get the book out the door. And somebody called me from a little prairie outside of my hometown in Lincoln, Nebraska and said, we think we've seen a bobcat. You can try to photograph your bobcat here. So what the heck? So I went out and I put this camera trap up along this game trail. Here's the camera in a waterproof housing. Right here is a transmitter and a receiver where an infrared beam is going across this game trail. And here's a little flash. And here's a little flash right here. So if something walks down here and steps over that log, in theory the camera should take a picture, right? For the first two months, this is what I got. Nothing. I don't know if it was the prairie fairies or if it was my friends playing tricks on me or what, but we didn't get any pictures of anything other than just nothing. And then, finally, after the turn of the year, we started to get photographs. Raccoon first. Bunny rabbit. Farmer Jones cat down the road. Farmer Jones dog down the road. Good job, California. I got a call in early March 2009 from my publisher, and they said, Mike, you got to pull the plug. Book's got to go off to print. You're done. I went out to pick up the camera traps. I had two pictures in the last deal. Here's the first one. And then an hour later, and it was really great to end with that photograph because that's the last picture that was made for this book. And it sort of creates the arc in the story for me because the look in that bobcat's eye is that same look that I saw in that burrowing owl's eye maybe 10 years earlier. The other thing was was that after traveling and being gone away from my family for all that time, I took this photograph 15 minutes from my home in a prairie that's been restored.\nComment: It is almost like that bobcat is posing..."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: great video,  very well edited.  I went out on the 12th as well it was too nice of a day not to!  we got a grey and a fox but then it started raining on us.  "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

We've just arrived at the school playground where there's an adult male roe deer unable to get out. There's a lot of blood on the ground, we're not sure whether it's because he's been running on the concrete or he's got an injury. Because he's down we're going to try to see if we can get to a point where we can get this little jab stick over him and get it into him because we know he'll then go to sleep very quickly. But it's not the easiest thing and they usually don't stand it, but it will save us having to try to catch him. Right, that was the end of that one. Absolutely screwed the needle. Okay, didn't work people. He's quite calm at the moment, but he could so easily jump over that fence just back and forth. Sean's got him really well contained, he's just very steady behind him keeping him calm. But we don't know where he's going to go from. Well, that was a much more sedate rescue than it might have been. The wound on his flank is very old, he's done it a long time ago. We can put a bit of gel on that and maybe give him an antibiotic. It's really old, it's healed. We just need to see where all this blood's coming from. I think the blood's from his hooves. These have bled and you can see where he's gone backwards and forwards across that end part. He's got a cut on either eye as well. That's old. This side's not quite so old. He's been in the wars a bit. He has. These are all really old injuries, they're completely dry. I've got the antlers protected so he can't do you any damage, will he? OK, I'm ready. OK, let's go on. Come on, fella. Steady. Get Lucy's expression well, Andy. No, don't. OK, we good? Well, the deer's here. Didn't have to walk very far. I'm not sure whether Lucy's ever going to walk again. She looks absolutely knackered. But he's ready to go. He's gorgeous. Straight into woodland from this field. He shouldn't go back towards the school, so he's on his own again for his second chance. We're looking at him probably as third or fourth chance, to be honest. Right, OK. And off you go, fella. Relaxed, wasn't he? He's really looking good. Just toddling off at his own pace, really. I'm in no rush. I'm back home. She's actually had five minutes to recover. But you can tell how unfit our vet nurse is, can't you? She might be good at her job. Get her to walk 200 yards and she's... Look at it. You're so naughty. If I hadn't had what I had, you'd have got an antler in the face.\nComment: You guys need to get more active! Haha. "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

As there are so many hungry cats in the area, we felt it'd be safer to box the ducklings up and carry them and mum down the road to a neighbours garden pond.Just pleased we were around to make sure there was a happy ending.\nTranscript: Recorder blares That's a big one, oh wow!

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: This is the sort of out of the box thinking that save lives. I watched something years ago on tv talking about this, and seeing the program years later and successful is great to see."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}
