I'm the director of Genesis Wildlife Conservation Center and the Sanctuary. We began in about 1983, and then it grew from there so that we're now a charity. We collect from the people who come here, donors. Some of it we get from foundations. But we rehab about 600 to 700 birds and animals every year. Most of them are released back to the wild, and some of them can be released to their own environment. Music Because he's so small, he wouldn't really stand a chance out in the wild. Are you guys looking for someone to take him in? No, we keep him and use him for education. You have to have permits to have any of the animals. We have to have federal, state, USDA permits, everything. Music I know. That's why we keep them well padded. All the cages are padded, so when they fall, they only fall to the bedding. That's Samsara. Sam I've had since 1998. Music Such beautiful birds. Sasha is now six months old. She came to us as a baby about five weeks old when the whole nest fell to the ground. Her brother did just fine, and he's already been released. But the female, Sasha, on the x-ray, it shows the right wing just really shattered and not able to pin it. So that's why she stays with us. And we take her around to schools, and we talk about their habitat and the need to preserve it. Music This black and white one down here, though, that has an interesting story because see how her wing droops? That's only part of her injuries. I had released her along with a bunch of other pigeons. And then when she came back, she was in the backyard, like in the middle of February, and it was snow everywhere. And I looked out the back window, and it was just blood everywhere. And I ran out to see what it was, and it was this poor little pigeon. And she had come back to get cared, I guess, or at least it was a safe haven for her. So we treated her. She's blind in one eye. She had a lot of, I mean, her whole side was ripped off. The wing was broken. So I treated her back. She fell in love with the old fantail pigeon. And when the old fantail got sick, she would take care of him. I had him inside in a small cage. She would get up under his wing and walk him to the dinner dish. And her story is that when she was about three weeks old, some kids found her in the bushes, probably while her mom was moving them from one place to another. So she spent the next nine weeks at the animal control, where she was placed in a cage next to dogs and cats. And then she was taken to the vet. So she didn't learn to fear any of us. So that's why she's got to stay with us. I tried to release her a couple times, and it was a failure each time. This one over here is Cali, Calahari. And Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. So she's about seven years old, and she's had a pretty bad life before. I got her from animal control in Ashe, and she had been there 11 months, and they were not able to place her with anybody that had a USDA permit. And you have to have a USDA permit to keep these cats. Hey, come on in. She was just spayed. Again, we use these in educational programs to show people that they really are very sweet animals. They're extremely intelligent, very curious animals. ♪♪ People think the only thing they're good for is just for shooting. They're just supposed to be a sport animal, and they're not. Of course, they serve a lot of different purposes, but other than that, they have their own right to live just because they are. God made all of us, and we all have a right to live. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ You can go to our website, which is genesiswildlife.org, and you can get an idea about our volunteer relationships. We have a lot of volunteers here. We have a lot of groups that come. Sometimes we can get 15 or 20 people. And, of course, you put in three hours. That's an incredible amount of work that we can get done in just one day. So it's really nice when we get Cub Scouts or ASU volunteers. As a matter of fact, we had the ETSU come, and they were the ones that built this whole deck behind me. They built the entire thing in one day, but we had about 20 big guys come here to do that. As far as donations, it's just not monetarily, but you can also donate lumber. You can donate time. You can donate equipment. We get a lot of people who just come with their building their homes, and they have a lot of leftover lumber, a lot of things like that. They can come, and we can use all of that lumber. We can use everything. We get people who just bring in linens, which is extremely important to us. Some people will bring in some of the dog food and the sunflower seeds, bags of bird seed. All of these things can be donated to us.

I'm the director of Genesis Wildlife Conservation Center and the Sanctuary. We began in about 1983, and then it grew from there so that we're now a charity. We collect from the people who come here, donors. Some of it we get from foundations. But we rehab about 600 to 700 birds and animals every year. Most of them are released back to the wild, and some of them can be released to their own environment. Music Because he's so small, he wouldn't really stand a chance out in the wild. Are you guys looking for someone to take him in? No, we keep him and use him for education. You have to have permits to have any of the animals. We have to have federal, state, USDA permits, everything. Music I know. That's why we keep them well padded. All the cages are padded, so when they fall, they only fall to the bedding. That's Samsara. Sam I've had since 1998. Music Such beautiful birds. Sasha is now six months old. She came to us as a baby about five weeks old when the whole nest fell to the ground. Her brother did just fine, and he's already been released. But the female, Sasha, on the x-ray, it shows the right wing just really shattered and not able to pin it. So that's why she stays with us. And we take her around to schools, and we talk about their habitat and the need to preserve it. Music This black and white one down here, though, that has an interesting story because see how her wing droops? That's only part of her injuries. I had released her along with a bunch of other pigeons. And then when she came back, she was in the backyard, like in the middle of February, and it was snow everywhere. And I looked out the back window, and it was just blood everywhere. And I ran out to see what it was, and it was this poor little pigeon. And she had come back to get cared, I guess, or at least it was a safe haven for her. So we treated her. She's blind in one eye. She had a lot of, I mean, her whole side was ripped off. The wing was broken. So I treated her back. She fell in love with the old fantail pigeon. And when the old fantail got sick, she would take care of him. I had him inside in a small cage. She would get up under his wing and walk him to the dinner dish. And her story is that when she was about three weeks old, some kids found her in the bushes, probably while her mom was moving them from one place to another. So she spent the next nine weeks at the animal control, where she was placed in a cage next to dogs and cats. And then she was taken to the vet. So she didn't learn to fear any of us. So that's why she's got to stay with us. I tried to release her a couple times, and it was a failure each time. This one over here is Cali, Calahari. And Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. She's a little bit shy. Cali was once a pet, but she's not a very good pet. So she's about seven years old, and she's had a pretty bad life before. I got her from animal control in Ashe, and she had been there 11 months, and they were not able to place her with anybody that had a USDA permit. And you have to have a USDA permit to keep these cats. Hey, come on in. She was just spayed. Again, we use these in educational programs to show people that they really are very sweet animals. They're extremely intelligent, very curious animals. ♪♪ People think the only thing they're good for is just for shooting. They're just supposed to be a sport animal, and they're not. Of course, they serve a lot of different purposes, but other than that, they have their own right to live just because they are. God made all of us, and we all have a right to live. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ You can go to our website, which is genesiswildlife.org, and you can get an idea about our volunteer relationships. We have a lot of volunteers here. We have a lot of groups that come. Sometimes we can get 15 or 20 people. And, of course, you put in three hours. That's an incredible amount of work that we can get done in just one day. So it's really nice when we get Cub Scouts or ASU volunteers. As a matter of fact, we had the ETSU come, and they were the ones that built this whole deck behind me. They built the entire thing in one day, but we had about 20 big guys come here to do that. As far as donations, it's just not monetarily, but you can also donate lumber. You can donate time. You can donate equipment. We get a lot of people who just come with their building their homes, and they have a lot of leftover lumber, a lot of things like that. They can come, and we can use all of that lumber. We can use everything. We get people who just bring in linens, which is extremely important to us. Some people will bring in some of the dog food and the sunflower seeds, bags of bird seed. All of these things can be donated to us.

Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.

If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.

This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.

Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3.

Also in my opinion, the ex orphan mothers who were about to give birth traveled purposely back to their keeper's place, to their home unfortunately on their way,  they could not hold it any more and gave birth, that is the explanation why when they finally came at their home, their baby was just 1 day or a few days old. They were not far away. Of course when giving birth, they preferred that their newly born calves were safe from predators so home territory is the ideal place, surrounded by their keepers ( human family ) and other elephants.  Ex orphans learned that they could count on their human family..so they keep on coming back, visiting, introducing their kids, asking for help etc.. They are also teaching their youngsters and their wild elephant friends about it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

That is what the people At Hoedspruit Endangers species centre are doing, so please u that haven done any thing to help, don’t come here and say what u Think is write, is to easy to judge, the difficult thing is to take action and do some thing to save the rhinos as my friends at HESC are doing!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The fact is that not a drop has been let through as of yet; the water is too polluted according to National Park regulations to run it south through the National Park. The question is if the water is flowed south will it be able to flow through the National Park the majority of the year? Now a 2.6 mile bridge is in sight, and additional 2.9 miles of bridging to proceed it. The problem we see is that the first 1 mile bridge has not yet been tested. The truth to the whole matter is, the Everglades biggest problem lies up north with pollution that should be corrected before spending taxpayers money on a science project that will be a permeant costly disaster if it does not work.We have studied the water flow patterns through the existing culverts for many decades. We have seen how the wildlife has been affected and have analyzed the situation as a whole. The ecosystem and wildlife is disappearing and suffering. Wildlife is becoming smaller in size, becoming weaker, and natural life spans are getting shorter. In 1998 a florida panther was found dead in Everglades Shark River Slough with levels of mercury so high it could kill an adult human.Right now and for the past several months before the 81 to 100 million dollar bridge was even finished water has actually been flowing through the National Park from south to north through the existing culverts; yes, backwards because the water is too polluted. Everyday a test by one of us has been conducted on the bridge to test the direction of the water flow. A hand full of sand is dropped at the opening, but it sinks straight to the bottom. If the flow of water was flowing south the sand would visibly be carried in that direction. Imagine 2.6 miles of water flowing backwards, (yes north) verses the culverts that are in place now. That equals a lot more water traveling north because water pollution regulations do not permit them to flow south through the National Park. Also sending water south would require permission from the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, which owns lands south of Lake Okeechobee and north of Everglades National Park. The Miccosukee Tribe is against the polluted waters being flowed into their land, and they are taking action to preserve their way of life. They would not be able to survive if the water and food is all poisoned. According to Earth Justice the pumps for polluted water on average contribute the equivalent of 60,000 one hundred pound bag of phosphorus to Lake Okeechobee each year.If the bridging is in place unnatural water depths will follow unnatural hydro-periods and water flow patterns. Now all the wildlife's hammocks will be under water, and there will be no dry land. This will result in unhealthy conditions. More water, more water, more water, is not the answer; Clean water, clean water, clean water, is the answer! Because of being in a hurry to build all these bridges that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars are we really going to sacrifice one environment to stop salt water intrusion down south into the bay? Remember there's only one Everglades and its all connected. All these bridges do not save the Everglades, they flood and pollute them more then they already are. We are affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. We have to treat the source of infection instead of covering it up with a bandaid.\nTranscript: Here we are west of the 2.6 mile bridge proposed area at the S333 lock. Water is not flowing into the Tamiami Trail Canal, the lock is closed. Here we are south of that lock. The water is traveling from the west to the east in the canal south of Tamiami Trail. These overflow pipes were located in this area and removed. When water levels would reach the height of the top of the pipe would flow into the pipe. They would act as an overflow and then flow water south into the canal, flowing the water into the National Park. The water now is flowing at a much more rapid rate into the National Park. The problem is it is making a U-turn and finding the path of least resistance due to sawgrass and a southern ridge. It is making a U-turn and flowing north instead of south. The opposite of what it is supposed to do. As the water flows north it travels through these pipes, culverts that flow into the Tamiami Trail Canal. This area is the center of the 2.6 mile proposed bridge. A bridge located here instead of the culverts would flow way more water north, completely drying out the south. You can see the rapid flow rate with three culverts. Imagine a bridge drying out and creating an unnatural drought south of the Tamiami Trail, interrupting the natural process of this part of the Everglades. Wildlife would suffer. Wildlife has already suffered enough due to over 25 years of held water in these areas and too much water and now more water is proposed, over 2 feet more in the canal. As of right now the National Park does not flow water south due to over 10 parts per billion of water pollution regulations. They have not been able to flow water south even through the one mile bridge. Here you can see water rapidly flowing north through these culverts, the area and center of this 2.6 mile bridge. This is not where the bridge should be located. During droughts this area has always flowed water north. Instead of here, the S3334 locks, when opened, create a suction that even increases drastically the water flow north from the south side, drying up the area even faster. Look at the flow going north into the Tamiami Trail Canal. The Everglades does not travel north, should not travel north. Man has interrupted water flows all over the entire Everglades and we are going to do it again with an irreversible situation and billions of taxpayer dollars. This is where the 2.6 mile bridge would be located. The locks at 3333 are closed. The water is traveling south down the L67 Canal making a U-turn and going back north you can see here on the map. The Blue Shanty, the new river, allowing large amounts of water flow north. This is the S3334 lock area. It is also closed. When opened and water flows south, this creates that suction, vacuum, dropping the water sometimes overnight or days, 6 to 8 inches. Unnatural, completely, not allowing the wildlife to adapt. This is not what is supposed to happen with the bridging. The bridging has to be thought about. The 1 mile bridge has not flowed a drop of water south ever since finished. The public has completely been misinformed. Taxpayer dollars are not at work. The 100 million dollar bridge has not worked. We have stopped and checked this area 3 to 4 times a week with a simple test. Water is not flowing in any direction and has not. When the lock is opened at the S333, it will flow south but sawgrass will clog the area restricting lots of flow. And again, taxpayer dollars will not be well spent. And right now, we must at least test the 1 mile bridge before creating more bad decisions. Another 2.6 mile bridge and maybe even more bridging. Bridge is not working right now. It has not for many, many months. The only way to make this water flow south is to create an unnatural level in the canal which will flow and flood the area, being detrimental and terrible for wildlife, especially mammal life. Heavy pollution coming from the north will kill aquatic life, affecting the food chain. This is not the Everglades restoration. This is the Everglades destruction.\nComment: Every time someone contacts the National Park for answers regarding this video they get the same general responses with no real answers.\n\nNational Park response #1) There is some localized northward flow just to the east of S333, because the water level on the west of the L67 extension levee is higher than water level on the east. \n\nNational Park response #2) The hydrology in the area is complicated, but we have been studying it for years and have a good handle on it.\n\nWhat they won't tell you because they can't is how are they going to stop the South side from drying up during times of drought, water pollution, or when lock #334 is opened because they need water? The answer is with a 2.6 mile bridge you won't be able to.\n\nPeople are finally starting to understand and it is very important for all of us to continue to watch & share this video as much as we can as we are the protecters of the Everglades."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Now a 2.6 mile bridge is in sight, and additional 2.9 miles of bridging to proceed it. The problem we see is that the first 1 mile bridge has not yet been tested. The truth to the whole matter is, the Everglades biggest problem lies up north with pollution that should be corrected before spending taxpayers money on a science project that will be a permeant costly disaster if it does not work.We have studied the water flow patterns through the existing culverts for many decades. We have seen how the wildlife has been affected and have analyzed the situation as a whole. The ecosystem and wildlife is disappearing and suffering. Wildlife is becoming smaller in size, becoming weaker, and natural life spans are getting shorter. In 1998 a florida panther was found dead in Everglades Shark River Slough with levels of mercury so high it could kill an adult human.Right now and for the past several months before the 81 to 100 million dollar bridge was even finished water has actually been flowing through the National Park from south to north through the existing culverts; yes, backwards because the water is too polluted. Everyday a test by one of us has been conducted on the bridge to test the direction of the water flow. A hand full of sand is dropped at the opening, but it sinks straight to the bottom. If the flow of water was flowing south the sand would visibly be carried in that direction. Imagine 2.6 miles of water flowing backwards, (yes north) verses the culverts that are in place now. That equals a lot more water traveling north because water pollution regulations do not permit them to flow south through the National Park. Also sending water south would require permission from the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, which owns lands south of Lake Okeechobee and north of Everglades National Park. The Miccosukee Tribe is against the polluted waters being flowed into their land, and they are taking action to preserve their way of life. They would not be able to survive if the water and food is all poisoned. According to Earth Justice the pumps for polluted water on average contribute the equivalent of 60,000 one hundred pound bag of phosphorus to Lake Okeechobee each year.If the bridging is in place unnatural water depths will follow unnatural hydro-periods and water flow patterns. Now all the wildlife's hammocks will be under water, and there will be no dry land. This will result in unhealthy conditions. More water, more water, more water, is not the answer; Clean water, clean water, clean water, is the answer! Because of being in a hurry to build all these bridges that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars are we really going to sacrifice one environment to stop salt water intrusion down south into the bay? Remember there's only one Everglades and its all connected. All these bridges do not save the Everglades, they flood and pollute them more then they already are. We are affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. We have to treat the source of infection instead of covering it up with a bandaid.\nTranscript: Here we are west of the 2.6 mile bridge proposed area at the S333 lock. Water is not flowing into the Tamiami Trail Canal, the lock is closed. Here we are south of that lock. The water is traveling from the west to the east in the canal south of Tamiami Trail. These overflow pipes were located in this area and removed. When water levels would reach the height of the top of the pipe would flow into the pipe. They would act as an overflow and then flow water south into the canal, flowing the water into the National Park. The water now is flowing at a much more rapid rate into the National Park. The problem is it is making a U-turn and finding the path of least resistance due to sawgrass and a southern ridge. It is making a U-turn and flowing north instead of south. The opposite of what it is supposed to do. As the water flows north it travels through these pipes, culverts that flow into the Tamiami Trail Canal. This area is the center of the 2.6 mile proposed bridge. A bridge located here instead of the culverts would flow way more water north, completely drying out the south. You can see the rapid flow rate with three culverts. Imagine a bridge drying out and creating an unnatural drought south of the Tamiami Trail, interrupting the natural process of this part of the Everglades. Wildlife would suffer. Wildlife has already suffered enough due to over 25 years of held water in these areas and too much water and now more water is proposed, over 2 feet more in the canal. As of right now the National Park does not flow water south due to over 10 parts per billion of water pollution regulations. They have not been able to flow water south even through the one mile bridge. Here you can see water rapidly flowing north through these culverts, the area and center of this 2.6 mile bridge. This is not where the bridge should be located. During droughts this area has always flowed water north. Instead of here, the S3334 locks, when opened, create a suction that even increases drastically the water flow north from the south side, drying up the area even faster. Look at the flow going north into the Tamiami Trail Canal. The Everglades does not travel north, should not travel north. Man has interrupted water flows all over the entire Everglades and we are going to do it again with an irreversible situation and billions of taxpayer dollars. This is where the 2.6 mile bridge would be located. The locks at 3333 are closed. The water is traveling south down the L67 Canal making a U-turn and going back north you can see here on the map. The Blue Shanty, the new river, allowing large amounts of water flow north. This is the S3334 lock area. It is also closed. When opened and water flows south, this creates that suction, vacuum, dropping the water sometimes overnight or days, 6 to 8 inches. Unnatural, completely, not allowing the wildlife to adapt. This is not what is supposed to happen with the bridging. The bridging has to be thought about. The 1 mile bridge has not flowed a drop of water south ever since finished. The public has completely been misinformed. Taxpayer dollars are not at work. The 100 million dollar bridge has not worked. We have stopped and checked this area 3 to 4 times a week with a simple test. Water is not flowing in any direction and has not. When the lock is opened at the S333, it will flow south but sawgrass will clog the area restricting lots of flow. And again, taxpayer dollars will not be well spent. And right now, we must at least test the 1 mile bridge before creating more bad decisions. Another 2.6 mile bridge and maybe even more bridging. Bridge is not working right now. It has not for many, many months. The only way to make this water flow south is to create an unnatural level in the canal which will flow and flood the area, being detrimental and terrible for wildlife, especially mammal life. Heavy pollution coming from the north will kill aquatic life, affecting the food chain. This is not the Everglades restoration.

Seems like when ever someone enquires about this video they get the same generic response with NO REAL ANSWERS to the problem. \n\nBelow is the conversation.................................................................................................................................\n\nDear Mr. Harkness,\n\nThank you for contacting the Sierra Club. We took a look at your video and consulted with scientists at Everglades National Park. Your video actually demonstrates the need to restore flow across the central Everglades and elevate Tamiami Trail.\n\nAs you have documented, there is some localized northward flow just to the east of S333, because the water level on the west of the L67 extension levee is higher than water level on the east. Water levels are substantially lower in Northeast Shark Slough than western shark slough because of water management. This all part of the reason why we need to restore more natural flow by elevating the road. The net water flow through the culverts documented by the US Geological Survey since 1939 is north to south, and water will flow north to south as we redirect more water into Northeast Shark Slough under the 2.6 mile bridge.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJonathan Ullman\nSenior Everglades Representative\nSierra Club\n\nThe reply to the conversation.................................................................................................................................\n\n\nHi Jonathan\n\nI would like to thank you for writing me and taking the time to look into this.\n\nKeep in mind the entire time since the 1 mile bridge has been built water has not flowed South underneath it.\n\nHave Water Management and the National Park explain why they have not flowed water South? This is the first question we should have an answer too. We know it has not flowed South because we have checked it everyday since it's completion.\n\nIn the future when water is available we know the water will flow South. We agree with everybody about this point. But any time it is not flowed South the water will flow North due to not having enough water, being polluted, or during droughts. The bridges are going to allow the South Side to dry up in less than 24 hours during droughts and will cause a shock factor to local wildlife. Even during times when water is flowed South water levels will be so high that wildlife will not have land, and the excessive amounts of water will rot the vegetation destroying our ecosystem.\nThis leads to the second question that needs to be asked and answered. How does Water Management and National Park stop the Northern water flow underneath all this bridging when lock 334 opens and water is flowed South East of the lock, and when lock 333 is closed? This will create a vacuum suction drying out the South Side. A better solution they should look into is putting locks in the place of the 2.6 mile bridge area. This will prevent Northern water flow, and have more control over the water while achieving the Southern water flow in times of need. This scenario might not be as pretty as the view from the top of the concrete bridge, but it sure will save the South side of the Everglades from flooding, and loss of wildlife.This is not something you just slap together because you get some taxpayer money. \n\nSierra Club if you truly care about the Everglades you will get answers for these specific questions and scenarios."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The fact is that not a drop has been let through as of yet; the water is too polluted according to National Park regulations to run it south through the National Park. The question is if the water is flowed south will it be able to flow through the National Park the majority of the year? Now a 2.6 mile bridge is in sight, and additional 2.9 miles of bridging to proceed it. The problem we see is that the first 1 mile bridge has not yet been tested. The truth to the whole matter is, the Everglades biggest problem lies up north with pollution that should be corrected before spending taxpayers money on a science project that will be a permeant costly disaster if it does not work.We have studied the water flow patterns through the existing culverts for many decades. We have seen how the wildlife has been affected and have analyzed the situation as a whole. The ecosystem and wildlife is disappearing and suffering. Wildlife is becoming smaller in size, becoming weaker, and natural life spans are getting shorter. In 1998 a florida panther was found dead in Everglades Shark River Slough with levels of mercury so high it could kill an adult human.Right now and for the past several months before the 81 to 100 million dollar bridge was even finished water has actually been flowing through the National Park from south to north through the existing culverts; yes, backwards because the water is too polluted. Everyday a test by one of us has been conducted on the bridge to test the direction of the water flow. A hand full of sand is dropped at the opening, but it sinks straight to the bottom. If the flow of water was flowing south the sand would visibly be carried in that direction. Imagine 2.6 miles of water flowing backwards, (yes north) verses the culverts that are in place now. That equals a lot more water traveling north because water pollution regulations do not permit them to flow south through the National Park. Also sending water south would require permission from the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, which owns lands south of Lake Okeechobee and north of Everglades National Park. The Miccosukee Tribe is against the polluted waters being flowed into their land, and they are taking action to preserve their way of life. They would not be able to survive if the water and food is all poisoned. According to Earth Justice the pumps for polluted water on average contribute the equivalent of 60,000 one hundred pound bag of phosphorus to Lake Okeechobee each year.If the bridging is in place unnatural water depths will follow unnatural hydro-periods and water flow patterns. Now all the wildlife's hammocks will be under water, and there will be no dry land. This will result in unhealthy conditions. More water, more water, more water, is not the answer; Clean water, clean water, clean water, is the answer! Because of being in a hurry to build all these bridges that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars are we really going to sacrifice one environment to stop salt water intrusion down south into the bay? Remember there's only one Everglades and its all connected. All these bridges do not save the Everglades, they flood and pollute them more then they already are. We are affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. We have to treat the source of infection instead of covering it up with a bandaid.\nTranscript: Here we are west of the 2.6 mile bridge proposed area at the S333 lock. Water is not flowing into the Tamiami Trail Canal, the lock is closed. Here we are south of that lock. The water is traveling from the west to the east in the canal south of Tamiami Trail. These overflow pipes were located in this area and removed. When water levels would reach the height of the top of the pipe would flow into the pipe. They would act as an overflow and then flow water south into the canal, flowing the water into the National Park. The water now is flowing at a much more rapid rate into the National Park. The problem is it is making a U-turn and finding the path of least resistance due to sawgrass and a southern ridge. It is making a U-turn and flowing north instead of south. The opposite of what it is supposed to do. As the water flows north it travels through these pipes, culverts that flow into the Tamiami Trail Canal. This area is the center of the 2.6 mile proposed bridge. A bridge located here instead of the culverts would flow way more water north, completely drying out the south. You can see the rapid flow rate with three culverts. Imagine a bridge drying out and creating an unnatural drought south of the Tamiami Trail, interrupting the natural process of this part of the Everglades. Wildlife would suffer. Wildlife has already suffered enough due to over 25 years of held water in these areas and too much water and now more water is proposed, over 2 feet more in the canal. As of right now the National Park does not flow water south due to over 10 parts per billion of water pollution regulations. They have not been able to flow water south even through the one mile bridge. Here you can see water rapidly flowing north through these culverts, the area and center of this 2.6 mile bridge. This is not where the bridge should be located. During droughts this area has always flowed water north. Instead of here, the S3334 locks, when opened, create a suction that even increases drastically the water flow north from the south side, drying up the area even faster. Look at the flow going north into the Tamiami Trail Canal. The Everglades does not travel north, should not travel north. Man has interrupted water flows all over the entire Everglades and we are going to do it again with an irreversible situation and billions of taxpayer dollars. This is where the 2.6 mile bridge would be located. The locks at 3333 are closed. The water is traveling south down the L67 Canal making a U-turn and going back north you can see here on the map. The Blue Shanty, the new river, allowing large amounts of water flow north. This is the S3334 lock area. It is also closed. When opened and water flows south, this creates that suction, vacuum, dropping the water sometimes overnight or days, 6 to 8 inches. Unnatural, completely, not allowing the wildlife to adapt. This is not what is supposed to happen with the bridging. The bridging has to be thought about. The 1 mile bridge has not flowed a drop of water south ever since finished.

The water level on the West side of the 333 Lock was at 9.8'. The 334 Lock on the East end of the L29 Canal was closed.\n\nHowever, we tested the water flow underneath the New 1 Mile Bridge and it was still not flowing South as it was intended to do even though the water table was raised.\n\nIt is great news that the water is flowing South today. The culverts radius is small and the water gets pushed through with pressure for it to travel South. This is a fact that Water Management knows about it. Another good thing about the culverts is you can block the water from flowing back North in case there is not enough water to send South, High Pollution, or in times of Droughts. If you put in place a 2.6 Mile Bridge you will have no way to control the water from coming back North. You also have to keep in mind when they open the 334 Lock to send water to the farms it's going to suck the water out from the South through the 2.6 Mile Bridge drying out the South side over night and there will be no way to stop it! \n\nHere are some questions taxpayers should be asking the Everglades National Park:\n\n1) Where will you get enough water to flow South all the time?\n2) How will you clean the water pollution fast enough?\n3) How will you stop the water from flowing back North when you do not have enough water or when it's polluted?\n4) Are you going to sacrifice the delicate Eco-System on the South side by drying it up overnight each time the farmer's need water?\n\nInstead of a bridge they should consider a lock to control the water or clear out the existing culverts and to put more focus on cleaning the water. "},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Have been living in California for 45 years and have had 13 different breeds of pigeons. The ones I have that have been able to escape a falcon,  not all the times, is a cross breed. I have crossed a Turkish Kelebek with a Birmingham roller and a Portuguese tumbler. I call it Portuguese rollerbecks. They summersault, dive, zig-zag but still once in a while they are a meal for the peregrine falcon.

They are some of the most beautiful birds out there. I once raised a coop of roller pigeons and it's amazing to see how they fly when falcon chased them. My pigeons dived and sped like a bullet from the sky. My diver pigeon dropped 1000ft from the sky all the way down home. One falcon target my yellow pigeon, however, she dived so fast and swoop up into the sky like a missile, the falcon couldn't catch her. I was so amazed to see how fast pigeons can be.

Still around a couple years later, which is nice to see. And a couple fancy daffodils. But the reason I started here is I wanted to show you this. It's a miniature maple tree. The leaves haven't come out yet. But this is what I wanted to show you. It's an egg case for a praying mantis. So if I'm lucky and I time it right, I'll be around when they start hatching out of there and hopefully get some pictures and video of them whenever that day comes. Right now, mostly daffodils are out. A couple tulips. And I'll just give you a quick overview. Kind of a lot of empty space. Rebuilding some things here. A lot of green of flowers to come later in the month or in May. There's another one. I love that flower, but maybe this year I'll pick a new channel icon. And these grape hyacinths are just starting out. There's a lot of them all along the border. This way and all the way around the front. This azalea is going to be a blazing pink. It's going to be great. And here's a few miniature daffodils. Around this tree, this birch tree. Nice daffodils again. Plenty of these around. This is a little tiny, comes from a tiny bulb. Comes back every year. I think I had this tiny, one or two flowers originally a couple years ago. In that spot and it's spreading. Is that one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Another one back here. And another one here that's not open yet. I can't, there it goes. It started out over here and now it's spreading across. So hopefully over the next couple of years this whole area will be filled with it. And then that's it. It's just a one time show.

Dude, that... Stay on the stand. That may not be... That may not be... the biggest buck in the world, but I may have just shot the biggest buck of my life. With a bow, anyway. With a bow. How was the shot? I was in the brush. Dude... It sounded solid. Dude, I saw it penetrate right up to the fletches, man. I think I went in a little back, but he was quartered towards the front shoulder. I think it was a solid, solid shot. I don't think he went far. It didn't sound like it the way he was crashing. He was down. He didn't go... He didn't go far. I'll tell you what, he wasn't out long enough. You know what? I'm shaking with you, dude. I'm shaking with you, dude. That TruGlow pin, man, I'll tell you what, it's not very lighted out, and that thing just lit up right on his vitals. And I guarantee you something, he ain't real happy about that wasp going through his pump house. That wasp just wailed him. Oh. Oh. Ha! This is it, baby. We're going to take a couple minutes here, relax, let him lay, and go see what we got, see if we can put our hands on him. Whew! Well, we waited a little while. We heard him crash. We know he went down really quick. There's blood right at the scene of the crime. So we're just going to follow it out real easy here, and I don't think he went far. I mean, that wasp went right through his boiler room, man, and he is bleeding really good, so I feel really confident about this hit. So stay with us, because hopefully next time I see you, I'll be holding one of the, if not the biggest, one of the biggest bucks of my life. I'm pretty jazzed about this. Here's the arrow. Wow! It is coated. He's not going to be far. Look at this. He's hit. He's stumbled. He's got it. He's got it. There he is, man. There he is. There he is, dude. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Whoa! Chocolate, chocolate antlers. Chocolate antlers. He's got to be 18, 19 inches wide. Oh, my God. This is it, man. This is why we do it. Rick, thanks for being behind the camera this morning.

He's got white on him and everything. I can't tell you what's going through me right now, man.

Number 1) stay warm.  Nothin worse than trying to shoot a bow while ur cold.  Also, don't wear bulky clothes, they will interfere with shooting ... make sure to practice shooting with EXACTLY what you will be wearing so u know what to expect.  Other than that, watch the wind, ur scent, and aim small, miss small ... wait for the right shot ... it's not worth losing a deer over rushing a shot.   Best of luck!!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Tinks, Lone Wolf Portable Tree Stands, Scent Blocker, Campbell Cameras, and Stealth Cam. Welcome to another action-packed episode of Bowhunter Dye. I'm Justin Zarr and alongside me as always is Todd Graff. You know, Todd, we've got two more really exciting buck hunts to share with our audience this week. We do. You know, it's been a great year. I've been fortunate enough to harvest my second buck here in Illinois. It's a buck's name is Captain Hook. It turned out to be quite the adventure on the recovery but it did work out okay in the end. Yeah, you know, I actually got to play a little part in that recovery but, you know, last week we talked about backing out after an unsure hit which is what you did and actually the other buck that we're going to feature this week which came from Dean Krieger, kind of the same scenario. He was a little bit unsure of the hit so he backed out and, you know, fortunately was able to recover his buck the next day. Right, you know, it's difficult to pull out. It makes really for a sick sleeping evening but in the end it is the smartest thing to do. Well, let's jump right in a tree with Todd on his hunt for Captain Hook. Beautiful buck. I don't know if he went down over there or not, guys. I made a nice Tony Vineyard shot. It looked to me to be a good shot. Oh, he popped right out of this corn. Scared those two smaller bucks away. I'm gonna have to re-watch the footage. I don't know how good of a shot I made or didn't make. I mean, it looked like it wasn't bad but he just didn't act the way I wanted him to act. I may have only got one lung. Let's get out of here. I've learned from experience when you find yourself in situations you just gotta back out, be calm, don't disturb the area. Hopefully he will not go far and he'll expire. Well, the Calvary has arrived. Mike and Justin just showed up. They're not hunting that far away from here so luckily they were able to come give me a hand. You know, that buck came in and I blew it. There's no question about it. I could have been a little bit more calm and I shouldn't have punched the trigger like the way I did. That buck was totally calm. I should have just gave him two more steps and I would have probably had a much better broadside double lung shot but you know what? We did all the stuff right. We pulled out. It's been over four and a half hours now so we're gonna go over at the point of impact, see if we can find my arrow. I'm pretty positive it was a pass through. We've watched the footage over and over and over. He went about 30-40 yards and just stood there for a while so let's see what we can find. I'm hoping that this buck didn't go too far. Let's take a look. We got some blood right here guys. I mean there hasn't been a lot of blood but we're still on the trail so that definitely makes me feel better. We just jumped him. That's not a good sign. That's enough to make you sick right there guys. Wait until tomorrow on this one. I'm here with my friend Scott Hill. He's my neighbor. You know what? It's so great when you got good neighbors when you own hunting property. There's nothing better and more valuable than a good neighbor. Scott was nice enough to, actually he was super nice. He left his wife go hunting this morning and he came out here and helped me track. You know, he went about another 100 yards. We found about four more beds. We just came up around the hill over here and there he is. He's laying right over there. He must have just went up the hill and then came back down. Oh my gosh guys. What an awesome looking deer. Come on take a look at this buck. It's November 7th. You know what? I found my buck, thank goodness, this morning. I shot him yesterday morning. I had great footage. You know, the buck came right in. Unfortunately, I made a mistake. I should have gave that buck at least a couple more seconds and he probably would have turned broadside to me. He's a good four and a half year old. Nice brown horns, heavy mass. He's got this really unique right side. There's nothing better than shooting a freak buck. I can't wait to check my stealth cams out. I'm hoping I got a couple videos up because this is really a good looking buck. He's just a good heavy horn. Nice looking buck. I am extremely happy. I am tagged out in Illinois. I'm going to head now to Wisconsin. I've got two tags left in Wisconsin. I'm going to head up there and see what I can get done in Wisconsin. It's been three years since I put one down up there.\nComment: Awesome video, thanks for bringing us the best!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

These open wounds on the flanks are caused by a species of biting fly which then deposits inadvertently some sort of parasitic worm, and they seem to carry these wounds without noticing. This belligerent, curious creature that knows only two habits, either runs at you or runs away, nothing in between. And then without the slightest warning just moves in fast and stops. And then... Satisfying his curiosity, getting human scent, he suddenly turns and runs and just heads away from that human scent. Runs through the grass away, tail up. What a sight.\nComment: @ToxicWorld75 As mentioned in the video.  Although it may look bad, the strange skin condition you see affecting this rhino seems to cause no harm to them at all.

What a sight.\nComment: @mistulac Hi there...The \"tail up\" posture you see in this video is more of an alarm signal - nothing to do with its need to defecate. In general, this specific posture normally indicates alarm or sexual responsiveness. Either way, it is probably not a good idea for a human to approach the animal if this signal is displayed. An uneasy or horny rhino is not a safe rhino! :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

This video was taken immediately following the charge and shows the aftermath of the mauling that never happened.\nTranscript: Okay, we're on Montague Island out of Port Chalmers and we're hiking up the mountain. We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around.\nComment: @CyprusHot  Ok now you're bringing GOD in to this? Have some respect. And for your info. the LORD himself said to us to be the terror and fear of all animals (Gen)  So don't talk about GOD. And why is it that whenever I comment on these issues the name calling starts?  Who's ignorant here? Really, ask yourself. Have I called you names and insulted you in any way? Anyways the point is the Grizzly may have been protecting herself, and so did the humans.

I understand that Bears charge because they're afraid. I understand that. But when you passionately say \"they're just scared\" what do you suggest the people do then? Stand there and say \"Well, we are in their land, so I guess we'll have to let yogi here kill us.\" Don't you see that's absurd? Even if the humans WERE the trespassers, we still have the right to protect ourselves right?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna.

I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide.

Also that verse is out of context because that verse is referring to an animal owned by some one (a domestic animal or cattle)as it says \"...cares for the needs of HIS animal...\" Therefore it does not apply to wild animals who are threatening humans. Also, in 1 Samuel 17:34-37 killing wild animals in self-defense is justified.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her.

If you get any of that spray on your hands and rub your eyes boy does it burn! I pepper sprayed a black bear in our carport this summer and some of the overspray got on the handlebars of my wifes bike. Had to scrub hard with soapy water to get it all off. Glad I noticed it before she did."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

It is obvious she only charged & attacked because she was doing what comes natural to her protect her babies at all cost - unfortunately you were forced to protect your own life @ all costs.

If you survive to tell the tale, good for you.  So many are not so lucky.  Bears are not bad, they are bears, and they are wild.  There is no fairytale story.  If you are getting charged from a brown bear that is not a good thing at all for you. And yes mankind can still enjoy wildlife and these amazing creatures taking all precautions to prevent this type of thing to occur. Even with taking all necessary precautions, this can still happen. Thankfully the two here were prepared so they can live to tell the tail."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

This video was taken immediately following the charge and shows the aftermath of the mauling that never happened.\nTranscript: Okay, we're on Montague Island out of Port Chalmers and we're hiking up the mountain. We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around.\nComment: They were deer hunting most people take rubber gloves and a rifle.

You both had no right doing what you did. In this instance idc if she charged, it serves you both right!!! This is why bears are disappearing. And most likely you weren't even making noise you probably were quiet the whole time and the woofing was her warning and yet these bullheaded humans didn't heed it and she charged as a result. Then they turned on the camera and said let's upload a video to YouTube to cover our asses. Now two cubs have to go without a mother, I hope you live with that and see there faces every time you close your eyes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

And I remember several years ago, Tyler, we took him on his first hunt. First time he'd ever been elk hunting, Perry Ross with his guide, and he gets a magnificent elk. And they're all kind of elk on top of that hill. We're setting up on a water hole this evening, and the weather's cool, it's raining a little bit, and it's got the elk up and moving early, and there are elk bugling all over the place. Tyler? Yes sir, he's right there. Go ahead and get set up to where you can shoot right here, okay? Hey, hey, he's going to come out right there. Yes sir. Hey, I will be giving you yardage. Tyler, you ready? Tyler, Tyler, Tyler. Tyler. I'm ready. Tyler, I'm ready. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. I'm ready. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler.

Don't shoot him until he stands now. Let him get stood up. Shoot him. Ready? Yeah. You got him. You got him. Great shot, son. Good job, son. That's probably the coolest thing I've ever done in my life. That is awesome. Look at there now. God, that's a big bull. First elk hunt. First evening. First elk ever. First evening. First day out. You were the man. You handled this. I mean, it was pressure. I know. Yes, sir. I could see you. Yes, sir. I was shaking. You've done a good job. Thank you very much. I really do appreciate it.

First released by Captain Cook for a food source for the pioneers of this country, the Feral Pig has thrived in our conditions and multiplied to almost plague proportions. Up here in the territory, the good living has seen the Feral Pig population explode. Cape York is probably the first destination most people think of when they think of pig hunting, but up here in the territory, their numbers are just as strong. I've heard of boars up to around 240 kilos being caught in the territory, but between 80 and 100 kilos is a good sized boar. They are an environmental terrorist, destroying vast tracts of land. In the south, they destroy crops and livestock, decimating the income of our already struggling farmers. Up here in the north, they tear our wetlands and national parks to shreds. No wetland has been left untouched. They act as carriers of weeds and exotic diseases, and they tear up the land until it becomes a mess of impassable pig ruts. Anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of driving across them will know what I mean. With a keen sense of smell, excellent hearing, and razor sharp tusks, pigs can be considered as dangerous game. Wounded animals are especially dangerous, and I've had a few close calls with wounded boars. There seems to be a lot of difference in opinion on what is the best calibre of hunting pigs. My opinion is, if it kills them, use it. I've shot them with everything from a .22 to a .375 Ultramag, but the latter can get quite expensive when you look at how many pigs we have up here. The smaller calibres can have problems penetrating the thick fighting pads and mud on the larger boars, so aiming at the base of the ear is your best bet when shooting with a small calibre. When using the bigger calibres, aiming tight behind the shoulder has always yielded good results for me. Herds of 30 or more are not uncommon. A group of animals this large will destroy a patch of dirt bigger than a football field every single food sitting. The feral pig is a real menace, and we as hunters need to do our part.\nComment: Hey Karl watch out boy just see the tusks and the size of them can’t take the dogs no count only machine gun can stop them"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Things that would be helpful would be a computer, a video camera, the ability to work hard, the ability to want to learn, the desire to feed my chickens and my dogs and water my fruit trees and my vegetable gardens and help me wash my dishes. So yeah, you can send me a message on YouTube, you can make a video, and we can go from there. So yeah, I could use help on my farm and I'm willing to teach someone what I know.

Visit the official BBC Earth channel:  EarthThe BBC Earth YouTube channel is home to over 50 years-worth of the best animal videos from the BBC archive. With three new videos released every week there’s something for all nature loves from astounding animal behaviour to beautiful imagery. Click here to find our more:  secret camera is hidden in a Hornbill nest before the jungle bird blocks the entrance for hatching. Fascinating insight into the private life of these colourful birds from BBC wildlife show 'Jungle'.This is a channel from BBC Studios who help fund new BBC programmes. Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: For hornbills, finding the right tree is crucial to survival. They need a roomy nesting hole, usually made when a large branch falls off a mature tree, which doesn't happen very often. Scientists have installed surveillance cameras into nest holes like this, to get an intimate, kind of big-brother view into the private lives of hornbills. These unique pictures show a female hornbill making herself at home. She needs to feel as comfortable as possible, because she's going to be a prisoner in here for up to four months. Once in, she starts preparing to seal up the door. She's plugging the entrance with mud, pieces of wood and sticky fruit, and leaving just a very narrow slit. And the reason why she shuts herself away is to lay her egg and protect her chick. From now on, she'll depend entirely on her partner to survive. He makes about ten or more runs a day, bringing back about a kilogram of food, a varied diet of fruit, insects, small reptiles and young birds. He stores it in his throat, and once back at the nest, regurgitates it for his family. With such intensive care, the chick grows fast, and eats mum out of house and home. After five weeks, there's only room inside the hole for him. Once a pair have found their ideal home, they'll keep on coming back for years. So trees like this are critical to the survival of these endangered birds. If this nest isn't available next year, this chick's parents may never find another.\nComment: .... I wonder if it would be possible to build a nest for the Horn Bill and would the birds use them.........We might be able to attract the birds with plenty of food and water and their own credit card. We live in the mangroves located about 2 or 3 hours by motobike and boats from Koh Kong Cambodia. There are flocks of Horn Bill birds here. I have no idea where they roost at night. Maybe a hotel...............If the chicks grow up in a home made birds nest, they might return next season."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

It didn't matter to you if you made a clean kill or not, you just took a chance.  It would be different if it was already wounded and you were trying to put it down to take this shot.  If you are going to post a video, get a tripod or learn to hold the camera still."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

The cute cubs play and explore with the lion whisperer, smelling new smells and seeing new sights.Find out about Kevin's cause here:  Website:     Kevin Richardson Wildlife Sanctuary's mission is to provide a self-sustaining African carnivore sanctuary for the purposes of wild species preservation through education, awareness and funding, especially pertaining to the rapid decline of large carnivores in Africa due to habitat loss, human-predator conflict, unscrupulous hunting, disease and their illegal trade.To raise awareness, Kevin has now set up his YouTube Channel 'LionWhispererTV'. The channel is all about raising awareness about not only the declining numbers of lions, but also how this rapid decrease is happening. By watching these videos, you are directly contributing to our scheme of land acquisition.Kevin captures the majority of his footage on GoPro cameras, allowing the viewer to get as close as possible to the lions. By doing this, Kevin hopes to give people an insight into the lives of these beautiful creatures and to let them see just what they can do to help. You can nearly touch them.\nTranscript: So we're going to be taking Georgie and Yami a walk. Let's go. Yeah. Time for a drive. And it's an enrichment walk. We do this with all the lions. It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back. There we go. There we go. Don't say I don't love you. So I hope you enjoyed your walk with Georgie and Yami. If you subscribe and join us, you can come on more of these walks and see these two guys grow up and join them on their adventures as they become big lions. Join us next time on a walk with Georgie and Yami. .\nComment: Fantastic walk.

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back. There we go. There we go. Don't say I don't love you. So I hope you enjoyed your walk with Georgie and Yami. If you subscribe and join us, you can come on more of these walks and see these two guys grow up and join them on their adventures as they become big lions.

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back. There we go. There we go. Don't say I don't love you. So I hope you enjoyed your walk with Georgie and Yami. If you subscribe and join us, you can come on more of these walks and see these two guys grow up and join them on their adventures as they become big lions.

The cute cubs play and explore with the lion whisperer, smelling new smells and seeing new sights.Find out about Kevin's cause here:  Website:     Kevin Richardson Wildlife Sanctuary's mission is to provide a self-sustaining African carnivore sanctuary for the purposes of wild species preservation through education, awareness and funding, especially pertaining to the rapid decline of large carnivores in Africa due to habitat loss, human-predator conflict, unscrupulous hunting, disease and their illegal trade.To raise awareness, Kevin has now set up his YouTube Channel 'LionWhispererTV'. The channel is all about raising awareness about not only the declining numbers of lions, but also how this rapid decrease is happening. By watching these videos, you are directly contributing to our scheme of land acquisition.Kevin captures the majority of his footage on GoPro cameras, allowing the viewer to get as close as possible to the lions. By doing this, Kevin hopes to give people an insight into the lives of these beautiful creatures and to let them see just what they can do to help. You can nearly touch them.\nTranscript: So we're going to be taking Georgie and Yami a walk. Let's go. Yeah. Time for a drive. And it's an enrichment walk. We do this with all the lions. It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back. There we go. There we go. Don't say I don't love you. So I hope you enjoyed your walk with Georgie and Yami. If you subscribe and join us, you can come on more of these walks and see these two guys grow up and join them on their adventures as they become big lions. Join us next time on a walk with Georgie and Yami. .\nComment: When Lion cubs are raised with the best of care, they grow to be the grand, beautiful animals God intended them to be. So grateful to have the opportunity to watch Yame and George Big Boys!  #savelions   #savehabitat  "},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

What a lot of people don't realize is the abuse that builds up to allowing that elephant to allow you to mount its back and to ride it. Many female elephants, when they give birth, they will actually kill their calves. And I feel that that is because they know what kind of life that baby is going to have and they don't want the baby to go through it. So they would rather just kill it as soon as it's born. It's a chain of cruelty that we have to stop right now. And the people who can stop it are the tourists coming to Thailand. They are the ones with the power. I am Catherine Connor, the founder of Bunlok Elephant Sanctuary Bless in Sukhothai, Thailand. Here, our number one priority is the elephant's welfare. We're not interested in profit. We're not interested in keeping the tourists happy. We just want to make a difference to the lives of these abused elephants. The rhythm here is beautiful. It's slow. We work on elephant time. You know, when the elephants want to go, we follow. If they want to stop and graze, we wait. And I think that for a lot of people who come here, it's a whole different world. It's a whole different way of looking and dealing with life. And I think that we change people when they come here. Here we have Phang Noi and Phang Soi. And behind you, you have Wassana, Lotus and Phang Dao. And they are collectively known as the Gossip Girls because they are non-stop trumpeting, roaring, squeaking, purring. You see, normally the cameras are all on them. People are wondering when it's going to be their turn. I have always had a passion for animals. And when I came to Thailand, I knew I wanted to see elephants. I began to volunteer at an elephant center in North Thailand. And I met a baby elephant called Bunrot, which is Thai for survivor. That baby elephant reached out and touched me. He changed my life forever. If he hadn't have died, I'm not sure I would have created BLAST because I would have just all my attention and all my focus and all my funds would have been going on to him. Elephants in Thailand, they were always held in very high regard. They were used for logging. And in 1989, Thailand banned that. And so what happened was thousands of elephants and their owners were unemployed. So what do they do? They're not going to give up their elephant. They need to provide for their family. That is when elephant tourism was born. Elephants are forced to perform tricks and the training that goes on to achieve that is diabolical. They're put through a breaking process. The baby elephant is stabbed repeatedly and beaten repeatedly until the spirit is broken. What it then becomes is a machine for the tourist trade. This is Bunthong. We found her in a tourist camp in Pattaya, giving trekking rides. So that means she had that big heavy chair on her back. As a result of years of doing that, she has a broken back. This is Wassana. She stood on a landmine when she was illegally logging on one of the Thai borders. Despite the fact that she is missing parts of her front foot, she was still sold into the tourist trade and forced to give rides. I mean at the end of the day, I don't think any of us are cruel. And I think most of the cruelty that goes on with elephants in Thailand is lack of education. I think most of these elephant owners don't know the damage that they're doing to their elephant's spine and joints. If they knew, I would hope that they would stop. At Bless, we have three guest houses that sleep two people each. We charge people to stay here. We have no programme, no schedule. We never encourage our guests to approach the elephant, encroach on their space. Our vision is to rescue the abused elephants, to recuperate them, to teach them how to be elephants again and then to release them onto protected land where they can live as wild elephants again. One of the biggest things for me, the thing that amazes me about them the most, is their ability to forgive. You know, these elephants, all of them have been abused by us, by humans. And yet, here they are, comfortable, accepting us, allowing us into their space, allowing us to walk along beside them. I just find that incredible.\nComment: 2020 when Covid-19 pandemic has occurred that brings many change to the elephants in Thailand in better way.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: All animals are amazing! Even flys are a part of the ecosystem they are here for a reason. Hunting something so important will not be good for the earth and just really, how, just why would you?

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: How many species have to go extinct before these hunters and poachers are punished for their crimes!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: Lion Guardians is a beautiful project."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: There are areas where the Masai are paid to protect the lions and where that happens the lions are thriving.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: Why you never had a \"Tiger Species Spotlight??\" That's weird.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: yeah we need to preserve them"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: @1HarryH Amazing place for sure!

During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: @Cheerio753 Buffalo NY?

I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see.

Maybe about 5 years back the city had a thing where they made Buffalo statues (like the one you are standing next to) and painted them all different ways. Then they sold them to benefit a charity.

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: Love the video.

You can tell the difference between the black and White Rhino due to the shape of their lip. He love's rolling in his mud bath and having a scratch, this beauty regimen also helps protect him from the sun and mosquitoes.

Cast Robert and Bindi Irwin.      Crew; Producer: Tom Armstrong, Camera Operator: Ryan Mooney, Sound Recordist: Scott Mulready. Editor: Lucy Garrick, Graphics: Matt White.\nTranscript: This is our gorgeous white rhino, Kai. Although he may look really big and tough, he's actually as sweet as a puppy dog. Well what Kai does is he's actually got a big mud bath in his enclosure. It's pretty cool. He gets a bit dirty. Sometimes when he has that mud all over him, he loves it if you can just pick it off and scratch. It just kind of feels like a massage. They have that mud on their back to help them as like a sunscreen and a mosquito repellent. They actually can't see really well. But Robert, what can they do? They have really, really good hearing. And what's funny about Kai is if you look just on his ears, he's got those little tufts of fur. Isn't that silly? We're not really sure why he has it. Maybe it's to keep the dust out of his ears. This is the white rhino. And they're different from their cousin, the black rhino, for a few different reasons. Firstly, these guys are grazers. So if you look at their mouth, they have that real rectangular shape and really big squishy lips. That's because they eat things like grass. But if you compare them to their cousin, the black rhino, they have a more triangular shaped mouth, don't they? Yeah. It's really pointy. And do you know why they have that? That's because they eat different foods. It's true. So they eat more like things like shrubs. Yeah, so rhinos can actually grow up to be two tons. They're really, really heavy. It's true. Now, the poor rhinos are in a lot of trouble. They're actually critically endangered because of that gorgeous horn. That horn is made out of keratin, which is the same as our fingernails. What people do is they'll kill the rhinos for that horn to turn it into traditional medicine. The biggest thing to protect rhinos or any wildlife is to never, ever buy wildlife products. Kai is one of our biggest animals here at Australia Zoo. But we have lots more, both big and small. So make sure you tune in next time. Yeah, and remember to subscribe to the Pet Collective channel.

This is the white rhino. And they're different from their cousin, the black rhino, for a few different reasons. Firstly, these guys are grazers. So if you look at their mouth, they have that real rectangular shape and really big squishy lips. That's because they eat things like grass. But if you compare them to their cousin, the black rhino, they have a more triangular shaped mouth, don't they? Yeah. It's really pointy. And do you know why they have that? That's because they eat different foods. It's true. So they eat more like things like shrubs. Yeah, so rhinos can actually grow up to be two tons. They're really, really heavy. It's true. Now, the poor rhinos are in a lot of trouble. They're actually critically endangered because of that gorgeous horn. That horn is made out of keratin, which is the same as our fingernails. What people do is they'll kill the rhinos for that horn to turn it into traditional medicine. The biggest thing to protect rhinos or any wildlife is to never, ever buy wildlife products.

I've only heard a couple gobbles, but we had a really windy night, so I don't know how vocal the birds are going to be. The game camera is showing birds are coming in here a little later in the morning, 1030-11 o'clock, so this may be a little longer hunting than we're used to, but we're going to give it a shot, and if we can keep the mosquitoes off of us, that'll be a pretty good morning. We're going to go ahead and get blacked out and see what happens. I've got 100 pictures of him too. I've got 3400 pictures of him in one day, so it's pretty good. Oh, there he goes.

Well, we got a little surprised on him. We knew we'd heard a bird over there probably, I don't know, 20 or 30 minutes ago, but he went quiet on us, and just out of the corner of my eye, I caught a bird strutting near the edge of the timber, and we didn't even call at him. He was bouncing in the timber already, strutting out in front of us. I couldn't shoot him for a long time because he was so close to it, but I'm pretty sure we got a decent shot off. It didn't screw up the decoy too bad, but it put him down, so let's go out here and see what he looks like. Well, opening morning's paid off pretty good for us. I'd done some pretty good scouting here, and the pictures were showing the birds were here, but man, when we set up this morning, we wasn't very confident in it. We had some birds quite a ways behind us, and then over here across the creek, we knew there were some birds. Well, we even talked about getting up and moving, but we went ahead and stuck it out for another 20, 30 minutes, and one of the birds we'd heard over across the creek, evidently he had moved in on us, and we didn't see him until he was about 30 yards away.

I've only heard a couple gobbles, but we had a really windy night, so I don't know how vocal the birds are going to be. The game camera is showing birds are coming in here a little later in the morning, 1030-11 o'clock, so this may be a little longer hunting than we're used to, but we're going to give it a shot, and if we can keep the mosquitoes off of us, that'll be a pretty good morning. We're going to go ahead and get blacked out and see what happens. I've got 100 pictures of him too. I've got 3400 pictures of him in one day, so it's pretty good. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Oh, there he goes. Well, we got a little surprised on him. We knew we'd heard a bird over there probably, I don't know, 20 or 30 minutes ago, but he went quiet on us, and just out of the corner of my eye, I caught a bird strutting near the edge of the timber, and we didn't even call at him. He was bouncing in the timber already, strutting out in front of us. I couldn't shoot him for a long time because he was so close to it, but I'm pretty sure we got a decent shot off. It didn't screw up the decoy too bad, but it put him down, so let's go out here and see what he looks like. Well, opening morning's paid off pretty good for us. I'd done some pretty good scouting here, and the pictures were showing the birds were here, but man, when we set up this morning, we wasn't very confident in it. We had some birds quite a ways behind us, and then over here across the creek, we knew there were some birds. Well, we even talked about getting up and moving, but we went ahead and stuck it out for another 20, 30 minutes, and one of the birds we'd heard over across the creek, evidently he had moved in on us, and we didn't see him until he was about 30 yards away.

My dog would bark at him and he would stay in our yard all day.  I think they liked each others company:)  These are neighborhood moose and they are use to dogs, children  and yes even adults telling them to get out of the garden.  We purposely planted flowers that moose do not eat. That was the only time a moose has ever tried to eat that plant. Thanks for your post!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The mother is very protective the first week . After that she is back to eating and building her stores back up from the previous winter.  As long as we are not teasing or bothering them they don't bother us.  Even dogs incessantly barking doesn't usually bother them unless the dog tries to nip at them.

There were a few notices put up by the hotel indicating that wild animals are not to be fed. Since this squirrel looked rather tame and more familiar with the surroundings I thought of giving it a banana :) May be it was used to the hotel guests feeding it. I was very close and was able to admire it while it was feeding itself. The surrounding of the resort hotel chalet where we stayed was rather interior and was bordering a Wildlife Sanctuary. Grizzled Giant Squirrel - (Ratufa Macroura) ================================= The grizzled giant squirrel is a large tree squirrel found in the highlands of Sri Lanka and India. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as near threatened due to habitat loss and hunting. Countries - Native - India , Sri Lanka Taxonomic Notes - There are three very distinct subspecies, with one present in India and all three present in Sri Lanka. Red List Category & Criteria - Near Threatened Justification - Listed as Near Threatened because this species is probably in significant decline due to habitat loss and hunting throughout much of its range. Range Description - This species is endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. In India it is known from only five severely fragmented locations, while it occurs more widely and less fragmented in Sri Lanka. Population - The Indian population has been estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals, and the population has been decling due to habitat loss and hunting The population of this species is considerably higher in Sri Lanka. Habitat and Ecology - It is a diurnal and arboreal species. It occurs in tropical dry deciduous and montane forests, where it is confined to the riverine habitats. It has a generation time of ~7-8 years. Major Threats- Habitat loss and degradation due to agro-industry farming, small-scale logging, selective logging, increase in human settlements, forest fire, inter-specific competition, competition from alien species, hunting for local consumption purposes, presence of domestic predators have been observed to be the major threats for this species. The grizzled giant squirrel's common name came from the grey to brown colouration highlighted with white at the top of the tail, giving it a grizzled appearance. The rest of the body varies in colour geographically and may be brown, red, grey or black, but the fur on the underside is always lighter than the back. This agile climber is adapted for life spent almost entirely in the trees, and has a very long tail for balance, broad hands for climbing and large claws for gripping branches. The ears are short, round and sometimes tufted.Music By Lohstana David from Jamendo .com\nTranscript: \nComment:  ~ EXCELLENT ~ i love squirrels & critters\n\nI have a few animal & squirrel videos on my channel"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Major Threats- Habitat loss and degradation due to agro-industry farming, small-scale logging, selective logging, increase in human settlements, forest fire, inter-specific competition, competition from alien species, hunting for local consumption purposes, presence of domestic predators have been observed to be the major threats for this species. The grizzled giant squirrel's common name came from the grey to brown colouration highlighted with white at the top of the tail, giving it a grizzled appearance. The rest of the body varies in colour geographically and may be brown, red, grey or black, but the fur on the underside is always lighter than the back. This agile climber is adapted for life spent almost entirely in the trees, and has a very long tail for balance, broad hands for climbing and large claws for gripping branches. The ears are short, round and sometimes tufted.Music By Lohstana David from Jamendo .com\nTranscript: \nComment: I enjoyed watching this squirrel, while it was feeding on the banana. I love its face - so cute, especially in close-up range. Like all squirrels it looks so adorable. I love the munching part with the music - so funny... It's really a big one  squirrel and very unusual in this respect. It cannot be as fast as other small squirrels are and it could be a problem for surviving. Thank you for this wonderful video. Have a happy and joyful week, my Dear Menu. Much Love and Hugs, my35Xvision. :)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

There were a few notices put up by the hotel indicating that wild animals are not to be fed. Since this squirrel looked rather tame and more familiar with the surroundings I thought of giving it a banana :) May be it was used to the hotel guests feeding it. I was very close and was able to admire it while it was feeding itself. The surrounding of the resort hotel chalet where we stayed was rather interior and was bordering a Wildlife Sanctuary. Grizzled Giant Squirrel - (Ratufa Macroura) ================================= The grizzled giant squirrel is a large tree squirrel found in the highlands of Sri Lanka and India. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as near threatened due to habitat loss and hunting. Countries - Native - India , Sri Lanka Taxonomic Notes - There are three very distinct subspecies, with one present in India and all three present in Sri Lanka. Red List Category & Criteria - Near Threatened Justification - Listed as Near Threatened because this species is probably in significant decline due to habitat loss and hunting throughout much of its range. Range Description - This species is endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. In India it is known from only five severely fragmented locations, while it occurs more widely and less fragmented in Sri Lanka. Population - The Indian population has been estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals, and the population has been decling due to habitat loss and hunting The population of this species is considerably higher in Sri Lanka. Habitat and Ecology - It is a diurnal and arboreal species. It occurs in tropical dry deciduous and montane forests, where it is confined to the riverine habitats.

Looks like he's heading right towards us. He's going to stick that big tusk right through there and take my wife away. He's coming right at us. Why do you want to walk on the road elephant? It's easy. I'm going to let him pass. Let's see what he does. Wow. He's just stepping away. Pretty miraculous. That's the closest we're going to see a wild elephant. I'm going to let him pass. He's coming right at us. He's going to take my wife away. He's going to take my wife away. Wild elephant. Thank you so much Mr. Elephant for a great show. Everybody's pulling up to see the elephant. Goodbye.\nComment: Very nice"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: I'm on the southern edge of the Namib Desert. Here, plants can't get water not because it's frozen, but because rain hardly ever falls, only about one or two inches in the whole year. Most of the time, it's bone dry and devastatingly hot. Yet, almost unbelievably, there are trees standing out in the sands, totally unsheltered, with no sign of moisture anywhere around them. Water storage is the great trick here. These green succulent leaves are full of it, and so are these bloated branches. The local bushmen used to cut off these branches and hollow out the spongy tissue and use them as containers for their arrows, which is why this tree is called the quiver tree. Its branches are covered with a blindingly white powder which reflects the heat, and its leaves have thick rinds with very few pores, which minimizes the amount of water they lose through evaporation. The trunk, even of an old tree ravaged by the years, remains smooth and impermeable, but even the quiver tree can't seal itself off totally from its surroundings. Living involves breathing, and some water vapour is inevitably lost in that process. But this tree has a way of reducing that. Self-amputation. It can cut off a leaf rosette and seal the stump. This branch will never grow leaves again, but with luck, the tree will just survive with a reduced number of leaves and put out new shoots when conditions improve.\nComment: David is my hero"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Flavio is a retired circus tiger and to the best of our knowledge he's 23 years old! This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: 2:18.. How Funny.

Even for animals, it is rare that such an old one does not show very noticeable cosmetic deterioration. Much love to you guys for keeping him in good shape, and making sure he's comfortable in his later years. He must have quite a lot of stories from his early days."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Flavio is a real beauty and is obviously a very special Tiger with a super sweet personality!!! I'm sad to see that Flavio has died since this wonderful video was taken of him. I'm grateful to Big Cat Rescue for taking Flavio in and making his golden years so peaceful, quiet and relaxed. Thank you to everyone at BCR for showing Flavio such respect and for showering him with love!!! You guys are the best!!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: It's usually 10-12 years in the wild, but in captivity with good care they can live to be 20+ years old, we had a cougar named Scratch who lived to be 29 years old!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Thank you for your wonderful questions.

At first I was crying because of the horrible cruelty and exploitation that these beautiful cats have experienced, but then I started crying tears of joy that Flavio (and all of the other critters that are in your care) finally gets to experience the beauty and happiness that they deserve. Although it is sad that Flavio isn't here on earth with us anymore, it is so very comforting that he got to spend his \"retirement years\" in a place where people loved and cared for him and made his life so enriching and happy. You can see the joy in his eyes when he is running around and playing, like he finally was able to be a tiger. I am so grateful that there are people like those at Big Cat Rescue who dedicate their time and lives to give these extraordinary animals the happiness and respect that they deserve."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Yes, we can.

That's the pond pulled to bits, we've removed the large stones from around the side, we've kept them fairly local, just tipped them over the back there to allow us to reshape the top shelf, we've whipped the liner out, there was a little bit of underlay in, carpet underlay, probably covering about 20% of the pond, so it was there as a token gesture, no more, we've dragged the cobbles back a little bit, that'll allow us to build a proper shelf here to retain the cobbles and then just push them back in so they don't need to be moved twice, same with the stones, once we get the shelves done around the sides we'll just be able to lift the stones back into position and cement them in. Right this morning we've reshaped the pond, we've dug the shelves a little bit deeper all the way around the edges, we've created a new shelf around here, the idea being to put a little bit of cement all the way along here, cement in some of these fellas and then pile the rest behind it to prevent them falling in. We've made this inner shelf around here a little bit taller, i.e. a little bit nearer the surface because there wasn't much space for putting marginal plants before, that shelf was pretty deep, it was about 18 inches, which is no good for most plants, we've made another little shelf in the bottom here and we've basically just flattened everything out, ready for the underlay. That's the underlay in now, more or less went in in two long sheets, that's one sheet, that's another sheet, we've sealed it with a heat gun, basically just put a little bit of fire between the two layers and pressed them together in this stick. So now it's time for the liner. That's the liner in now, it's one mil rubber, Firestone liner, we've started filling it up, we're probably going to fill it up until it's just over this shelf here, that should pull the liner in enough for us to work on this top shelf, cementing the stones in. It's pretty important to fill it up sufficiently so it pulls the liner in and makes it tight, otherwise if you just bray on and put the edging stones on when the liner's loose, when you fill it up, it can pull the edging stones in and make a real mess. This is the edging just about half done, we're putting a little ring of cobbles cemented in around the beach edge here, then we can cut the liner off, pour the cobbles back over that and it retains the cobbles quite nicely. We've gone round the sides with stone, well gone halfway round the side with stone, obviously the water's still got quite a long way to come up, but we're going to stop it just shy of those stones there, just in case we get any rain overnight, we don't want it to affect the cement that we've put on. All these gaps will be filled in with soil and then we'll cut the liner off. It's coming together quite well. It's the end of today, we've cemented all the edging stones on, put the cobbles back in position, had a bit of a tidy up around the edges, the water's still got to go up by 8 or 9 inches or so to cover the exposed liner there, but we're leaving it at this level just so it doesn't interfere with the cement. So really now all there is to do is just leave it for a couple of days, top it up and then get the video of the finished pond. That's about it. We've filled the pond up to about 6 inches below its full level, that's to allow the cement that we put around here to go off properly, that was the last bit of cementing that we did, so it'll still come up, probably halfway up these stones that surround the pond here. It's reasonably clear because most of it is water straight out of the tap, although we did put a little bit of pond water back in, it was probably about 300-400 litres went back in. That's it, another one down. If you've liked this video, click the like button, give it a thumbs up, if you haven't liked it, go away and watch some cat playing a blooming keyboard or something.

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets.

I have a nursing vixen that visits me daily (more than once a day sometimes) for food. I'm really looking forward to seeing her cubs, but her earth is just out of sight from my garden and so I'm still waiting. They are nearly nine weeks old now, so maybe they are a bit bigger than these ones - wouldn't mind knowing how old these ones are if anyone has a good idea. I'm probably not going to see them until they start to wander a bit more - but at least now I can see what I'm missing. Thanks again."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

And it looks great. I think it's going to be a perfect night. We're going to get in, let things settle down, and we'll hope for the best. He's right there. Right there. He's not walking right. Perfect buck. He's going to drop his head real low every step. Dude, that was perfect. 20 yards right out of the wood line. Bush in the bag, baby. Ground blind. Perfect. Perfect. He's 100 yards. Perfect. Lunged him. Those TrueFire broadheads, Switchblade broadheads, fly like field points. There is no better flyer right now. Amazing. Awesome. What a buck. Had a limp. Great buck to take this time of season. Got my Zero Detect camo on, camo suit. I mean, goes perfect. It's early season. This brownface in the early season is perfect. You can skyline it. You can be on the ground. Couldn't ask for anything better. I can't thank Gibbs Archery Gear enough. Have you guys seen this bow sling that they got? It's better than anybody else's out there. Let's go find it. We shot this buck late in the evening, and we lost light. So I called Mike and helped him come out here and follow the blood trail. That's where we're at now. We're not too far away. We had a good frost last night, so it was able to freeze a lot of the blood on the leaves and in the soybean field. We've been able to track it very easily up until it got into this thick cover. I think we're pretty close. It's starting to clot up. We're finding it about every 10 yards, finding spots of blood, so it should be real close. Let's head down this way. Still on it here. I don't want to have to work along this bank. He's in the water. That's got to be my deer right there laying in the water. We're going to have to come up with a plan to get this thing out of here. I got a couple hooks on this. I think I can get him. He's maybe 17, 18 inches wide. Not a huge buck. But with that limp, he was a great buck to take. I mean, he's exactly what we were looking for out here. That's a good buck. Your second Ohio buck? This is my number two Ohio buck, yeah. Awesome deer. Yeah, I'm happy. Great way to find it, fishing it out of the water. This is the second deer I had head to water in Ohio, too. He's awesome. The hard part's done. We got him out of the water. Now I can just drag him on out. Get the four-wheeler down here and get him out of here. Alright, thanks man. No problem. Congratulations.

The cats' efforts were captured by high-definition and slow-motion cameras for the Saving a Species series for teachers.Subscribe to our channel on YouTube:  to our print magazine:  our Blog:  us on Twitter:  a fan on Facebook:  our TV show: \nTranscript: Today we're shooting an episode of Shamu TV. It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection. It's just something that we've been doing for a long time.

It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection. It's just something that we've been doing for a long time. We're very passionate about our care for animals and we want to share that with everyone.\nComment: I want to see one running FULL SPEED.

Here two doe and two fawns come up to the bird feeder (they generally inspect it after dark). Although they were very hungry, they were even more curious about the cat. Deer do not appear to understand what domestic animals are and are exceedingly curious.The cat was curious also. The deer kept their distance, but spent some time looking over the cat. One fawn seemed to not be in the best of a mood. It hit its mother with a hoof at least twice (at ~ .46 and 1.2).The deer kept getting closer to the cat by hiding behind the snow drift, then going back to the tree. The snow was so deep that the deer could hardly run through it, when they left.The previous Video begins with view of field and trees taken immediately (~1-2 days) before the storm. Wildlife includes whitetail deer (which are loosing their antlers), wild turkeys, turkey vultures (sighted here for first time of year), and crows. Video then shows blizzard beginning at night. Nighttime animals out included raccoons (only 1 was photographed) and a coyote. These animals were videotaped in infrared. The  storm was getting bad during the coyote filming. Video then shows view of the storm. Only the closest trees were visible during the whiteout, as compared to the normal view of the area. Small snow whirlwinds, tornados, and gusts traveled across the landscape. Snow was cleared here with backhoe.The record breaking snow fall was 20.4 inches. The previous mark in Ohio for snow during 1 storm was 15.3 inches. And this record was made in 1910. Blizzard was compared to the famous blizzard of 1978. Streets were closed, a snow emergency was declared, and plane travel stopped (although I heard a jet while I was filming the coyote). A level 3 snow emergency was declared in many counties. Freeways were closed. Cities had parking bans. Contingents of several snow plows pulled through, some slid off the road. Many accidents occurred. People intending to vacation in warm places were stuck in Ohio.After the storm traffic was still stopped. The streets were used for sledding and snowboarding.Additional views of wild deer on the farm include:LARGE BUCK FIGHT-LOCK ANTLERS, ENTANGLED, CLOSE WHITETAIL  Non-Typical Moose-Sized Buck DEER - ACTION SHOTS RARE WHITE WILD WHITETAIL BUCK  views of this white deer: white deer on the farm -- the banded one & sibling: white deer being stalked by coyotes: strange deer on the farm deer fighting bucks run and jump bucks fighting COYOTES VS.

The hyenas moo to show affection like a cat purrs.  Then they laugh when getting ready to eat.   They are one of the most intelligent and powerful animas in the world.  Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not. But kind of like a\nComment: *seeing her go on with the talking* Hey!

So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share?

And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast.

It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah.

You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share?

So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart.

It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi.

I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share?

They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: And this is the work of the master builder among bower birds. I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions.

I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions.

I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: Just imagine how complex that birds brain must be.

I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: damn, that's impressive."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The crazy games of young stoats help them develop the killer tactics they need to catch their prey. As rabbits are fast moving, quick-turning, and ten times bigger, the slim-lined stoats must develop their hunting skills early to stand any chance of catching these relative giants. Despite their small size and short legs, stoats can carry on going where their prey might start flagging.Life | Episode 7 | BBC#bbcAll our TV channels and S4C are available to watch live through BBC iPlayer, although some programmes may not be available to stream online due to rights. If you would like to read more on what types of programmes are available to watch live, check the 'Are all programmes that are broadcast available on BBC iPlayer?'

Watch as wildlife managers count Mexican wolves to find out if 2014 is a record-breaking year. This video was created by the Information Branch of the Arizona Game and Fish Dept. Producer: David Majure.\nTranscript: December 2014 in the White Mountains of Arizona, a trail cam placed near the carcass of an elk records a pack of Mexican wolves showing up for breakfast. It's nothing unusual, yet it's absolutely extraordinary, especially when you consider that Mexican wolves nearly became extinct. By the early 1970s, there were zero wild Mexican wolves in the United States, and only a smattering could still be found in Mexico. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Mexican wolf as an endangered species in 1976. Today, Mexican wolves are making a comeback in Arizona and New Mexico, thanks to a captive breeding program and a reintroduction project that's been releasing and managing wolves since 1998. It's a partnership between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the Forest Service, the White Mountain Apache Tribe, and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. From the get-go, the goal was a self-sustaining population of at least 100 wolves by 2006. It's taken us almost 10 years after that to even come close to that number. Go find a location on RIM, go find Tsewa, only you're going to be over there on White Mountain. Jeff Dolphin is team leader for Arizona Game and Fish on the interagency field team, which does the day-to-day management of this experimental population of Mexican wolves. Does anybody not know what they're doing tomorrow? At the end of each year, the team does a population survey to find out how many wolves are living in the wild. We've got 10 animals, we're just trying to find 1331. The front seat can just turn the antenna and find the wolf just by turning it that way. They use radio telemetry to search for wolves wearing radio collars. When they find a wolf without a collar, or one that needs a new one, they may try to capture it. Chasing wolves through tall trees in a helicopter is difficult. It's probably some of the most demanding flying I do, just between the terrain, the trees, and trying to follow a running wolf through the trees without running into anything. It's very demanding. And sticking it with a tranquilizer dart is never easy. I'm looking out of the helicopter or muggers on the side trying to locate the wolves with the radio telemetry. What you're witnessing is wildlife management in action. It's unbelievably challenging. You just got to be patient and persistent. And it's infinitely rewarding. All of these wolves right now are wild born, wild raised, and they're surviving on their own. They're not needing help to survive from us. They're doing what we want them to do, but we're really seeing a dramatic incline in the population right now. When a wolf is delivered, the processing team goes to work immediately. Who's doing the microchips? This animal came in pretty hot from the chase and everything else, and through the IV fluids and cold packs, we've actually got her temperature back down to normal. The team documents the wolf's physical characteristics. It provides immunizations, monitors vital signs, and does any doctoring that's needed. So this is pretty much a resolving bite wound. The priority is to get the animal collared and back into the wild as soon and as safely as possible. For three straight years, the Mexican wolf population has increased by at least 10%. But this year's count was better than ever. The 2014 Mexican wolf population survey documented a minimum of 109 wolves in the wild, a 31% increase that finally broke the century mark. We're busting at the seams with wolves right now for this recovery area. With 19 packs and 38 pups, the future is bright for Mexican wolves. And it's only getting brighter. In 2015, big changes to the rules governing the recovery efforts gave Mexican wolves more room to roam. The area they're allowed to occupy in Arizona and New Mexico grew from 7,000 to more than 150,000 square miles. And the goal for the number of wolves more than tripled, from 100 to as many as 325. It's a number the project partners believe will give the wolves the greatest chance of success. A number that strikes a balance between the wolf population, available prey resources, and public acceptance. A number that ensures the Mexican wolf's comeback continues.\nComment: I am so happy that the mexican wolves are in the wild and more and more are coming god bless the people who saved this wolf species"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

It is highly unusual to see what I think is a stoat, the smallest of the mustelids in NZ, going for prey as large as a hare. It must have been very hungry, or had a litter to feed. This is a very good film catch - well done! [Hear the call of the shining cuckoo in the background?] People ask why it bites the back of the neck. Mostly to avoid getting kicked and raked by the legs of its prey, also to avoid being bitten."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

I live next to the area where the owl is and people are getting way to close and I am sure the owl has to be annoyed at the fact that people won't leave him alone long enough to hunt. His eye should be on his food source not on human because people are there from daylight to dark, people are actually driving his food source away by walking on his hunting grounds... people are climbing fences etc to get to him...STOP just my opinion.

There is another Rifle called the 28 Nosler , it is The 7mm RUM it is a 404 Jeffery Necked down to 284 , that is exactly what the 7mm RUM is ,  I would want to stand a 7mm RUM next to a 28 Nosler to see what the exact difference is in height ."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

It's a planer green. That's a female kin parrot. Bright orange head are the males. It's usually the case with parrots. The males are much brighter than the females. Males have to do all the work in relationships to attract a partner. Doesn't remind me of any species that I know apart from parrots. Musical chairs for the me. Poke the koala. I'm not really poking the koala. That's an optical illusion. They don't normally come this low in trees. But it's a good opportunity to see one having a sleep. What koalas do best. Go wake. Wake up. Wake up for the viewers. Wake up. Oh, Peter are going to be all over me for this. Longer term viewers will be able to pick. I'm at Anglesey golf course. Public golf course near Melbourne. It tends to get overrun by kangaroos in the end of the day. They come out to graze on the greens. Guess they save money on lawn mowers here. So, yeah, they're all over the place. Come down with Cory and Dana in amongst the trees. There's a bunch more. Essentially, this seems like kangaroos smorgasbord during the day. I think they go up into the hills behind me. In the late afternoon they like to come down here and have a feed from this nicely manicured grass. Like I said, maybe it's only nicely manicured because they're the ones looking after it. But they seem happy anyway.\nComment: @AngryAussie It amazes me the thousands of lorikeets that congregate to all of the beaches at the same time every day. Thought I was going to go deaf!

Wake up for the viewers. Wake up. Oh, Peter are going to be all over me for this. Longer term viewers will be able to pick. I'm at Anglesey golf course. Public golf course near Melbourne. It tends to get overrun by kangaroos in the end of the day. They come out to graze on the greens. Guess they save money on lawn mowers here. So, yeah, they're all over the place. Come down with Cory and Dana in amongst the trees. There's a bunch more. Essentially, this seems like kangaroos smorgasbord during the day. I think they go up into the hills behind me. In the late afternoon they like to come down here and have a feed from this nicely manicured grass. Like I said, maybe it's only nicely manicured because they're the ones looking after it.

My favorites, the lorikeets. I couldn't help but noticed the minor birds attacking the kookaburra's all of the time. Why do they do that? Are they looking for easy food? I swear this one in the backyard wanted to kill the kookaburra while it was trying to sleep. It kept flying and pecking at it's poor head.  Loved this video. "},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over.

And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over.

But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy.

And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: rats are incredibly intelligent and social animals! i used to have them as pets when i was a kid"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: Encounter with a tiny mule deer with a friend I consider a big brother, he was teaching me stalking, it snorted loud. I will never forget it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: I ran into a large bear (It was brown in color, at least on the back, but it must have been a black bear) on the back side of Cascade in '92 or so.  We had stopped to pick some berries in a ravine, and noticed we weren't the only ones enjoying the harvest.  It was at the top of the ravine maybe 15 yards away gingerly eating the berries.  I motioned to my buddy, and we both silently agreed he needed the berries more then we did.  We slowly backed up and took the long way around (I now know that was probably not the best strategy, but it worked).  The bear never seemed to notice us.  Since then I had a chance to see many larger Brown Bears even closer at the Katmai bear camp in Alaska, which was awesome, but somehow running into that bear in Utah stands out in my mind."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Anyways, it was spring or early summer and I was burning some trash in a barrel in the yard wearing my bright red baseball jacket. This jacket had stainless steel buttons. So,I am burning the garbage when I see this hummingbird fly maybe 5 feet away and about 2 feet above my head.making its distinctive hum, its just staring at me as its sitting there(flying). Well, I guess it though I was some motherload feeder,lol, because it came right up and stuck its beak into one of the steel buttons(the female one had a small hole straight through), realizing there was zip in that one it reversed to find the other button below and tried again but still no sweet syrope to be had then it did a final back away, stop, stare and buzzed away."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: That porcupine was cool; lucky where you go there are actually animals. Everything is dead where I live, and I'm lucky if I see a lizard or deer. No interesting animals like moose, porcupines, elk, beavers, crocs, or anything like that here."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage.

They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: Very interesting, thank you."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals.

Up backpacking with the kids and brother-in-laws Uncle Bingo and I had a close encounter with a Bull Moose. Returning to the car to gather extra gear for the kids at dusk, turned a bend on the trail and a bull moose was not too far off. I was in his comfort zone and he let me know it. Some very raw footage and just a snapshot of the trip. Also, Bingo and I having some fun talking about the youtube series \"Guy on a Buffalo.\" Personally I find it funny.Please visit \nTranscript: Let me set up this video for you. So I went backpacking, well, if you want to call it backpacking, with my kids, my brother-in-laws and their kids. Because we had so many young kids with us, we actually didn't go in very far at all. But we went in, found a spot, dropped all our stuff, and some of the adults stayed with the kids, and me and Uncle Bingo, actually, you've seen him in my films before, we went back down to the car to get the rest of the sleeping bags and that kind of stuff. But what happened is, I actually went down first. I kind of bushwhacked a little bit, you guys know how I like that, and then I hooked up with a trail later, and I was just, oh, I don't know, probably 50 yards ahead of him. And as I'm walking down, I'm almost to the street, and I notice a car was parked on the street right where our cars were parked, and it was just sitting there. I'm thinking, what is that car doing? As I walk and I come around this tree, I look over and there's a nice big old bull moose. And he's, well, he's not huge, but he's sitting there and he sees me come around the corner, he stops and he looks at me. And then my brother-in-law, Uncle Bingo, starts coming behind me, and I tell him to kind of be quiet because I want to get some film of this guy, and I kind of wave him over. But one thing I always talk about is looking for body language, and you're going to see it in this one. One of the signs of aggression that moose exhibit when you are in their space is they will often lower their heads, their ears will lay back on their heads. And then this guy, he started a beeline right at me. Now, what to look for here is, the first thing I did when I saw him, I thought, yeah, we're kind of close, but I'll be honest, you get a camera in my hand and all I'm thinking about is getting a shot. So I get my camera out, and when he starts coming at me, I'll edit this so it's kid-friendly. But I actually switched the camera to my left hand so that I could get my Glock 27 out of my ribs pack with my right, but it was just very sloppy because I'm trying to film him and I'm trying to get my gun out and I'm trying to watch him all at the same time. And anyway, I'll have you take a look at this, it's kind of fun. So of course, this is when I first see him. I get the camera right out of the pack. He hasn't seen me yet, but then he turns right here, bam, he sees me. Now it doesn't take him long, lower his head, see him lower his ears. Now, at this point, for some reason, I go into a weird accent and I'm trying to fish my Glock 27 out. Although I do have some good footage of you. Not really because it's so shaky. I think we're just kind of right in his way, there he goes, he's alright. Now what ensues here is me and Uncle Bingo just really enjoying the experience and talking about it, and it's very raw footage guys, it's just kind of a snapshot of this trip and a very unpolished snapshot of that. Is there two of them? Oh yeah, there is. Is it a bull or is it a cow? The thing is, is we're getting into rut season. And that means they get pretty ornery. Not quite though, but close. Looks like they're just doing their thing, I love this man, jeez. Good thing you stopped me, I came charging down the trail, making all kinds of sounds to scare bears, but. Uncle Bingo of course. You would have just took me out. I mean the cars are just right there, that's where the road is. And the bull moose and what we think is a cow. And we're pretty dang close to that bull moose right now. Let's see if I can... He's just right there, he's watching us. He's okay. He's alright. They really blend in if you're not watching. Yeah, they do don't they? As big as they are. Okay, this is what we're going to do. I'm going to film you. You run up, slap his butt, or spray paint it, and run as fast as you can. I'll tape the whole thing, this will be great YouTube footage. This will be like missing the Sasquatch a little bit. Okay, I'm in. Okay. We just forced him in the brush. Now see, I can't tell if he's eating or maybe... Look at this, maybe this is his bed. He's like, hey buddy. Get away from my bed. This is about as close as I dare get. We're probably 20 feet apart with a lot of brush in between us. He seems pretty calm. He's just gone about his business eating again. That's one thing I do, is really watch their body language. And understand where you are too. I know a lot of you guys tell me... I've had several guys in Alaska tell me, you could never do this. In Alaska with the moose that they have. Sorry guys, I'm not filming too well right now. I'm more watching him than trying to film him. Hey look, there's a baby. Awesome. Put him in your pack. What? Got straight up mauled by a cougar. Got on a buffalo. Buffalo sounds. We're approaching moose territory again. And this is our strategy. We've got plenty of sleeping bags. So if he charges us, we use the sleeping bag as a shield, punch him, wrestle him down, hog tie him. Good to go. I could do a drop kick to knock him over. That would be cool. We need to set up the camera though, so we can get it all on tape. Where's your action camera? Do you see that one? The bear one? That's freaking hilarious. He's right there, hanging out. He's the guy in the hat with the cool hat. Knock your hat, but it's not going to save you. Where he knocks the stove over. Knock the stove over on your foot. Ouch.\nComment: Always get a kick out of seeing wildlife in their natural habitat. The moose was pretty cool too ;-)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

And then my brother-in-law, Uncle Bingo, starts coming behind me, and I tell him to kind of be quiet because I want to get some film of this guy, and I kind of wave him over. But one thing I always talk about is looking for body language, and you're going to see it in this one. One of the signs of aggression that moose exhibit when you are in their space is they will often lower their heads, their ears will lay back on their heads. And then this guy, he started a beeline right at me. Now, what to look for here is, the first thing I did when I saw him, I thought, yeah, we're kind of close, but I'll be honest, you get a camera in my hand and all I'm thinking about is getting a shot. So I get my camera out, and when he starts coming at me, I'll edit this so it's kid-friendly. But I actually switched the camera to my left hand so that I could get my Glock 27 out of my ribs pack with my right, but it was just very sloppy because I'm trying to film him and I'm trying to get my gun out and I'm trying to watch him all at the same time. And anyway, I'll have you take a look at this, it's kind of fun. So of course, this is when I first see him. I get the camera right out of the pack. He hasn't seen me yet, but then he turns right here, bam, he sees me. Now it doesn't take him long, lower his head, see him lower his ears. Now, at this point, for some reason, I go into a weird accent and I'm trying to fish my Glock 27 out. Although I do have some good footage of you. Not really because it's so shaky. I think we're just kind of right in his way, there he goes, he's alright. Now what ensues here is me and Uncle Bingo just really enjoying the experience and talking about it, and it's very raw footage guys, it's just kind of a snapshot of this trip and a very unpolished snapshot of that. Is there two of them? Oh yeah, there is. Is it a bull or is it a cow? The thing is, is we're getting into rut season. And that means they get pretty ornery. Not quite though, but close. Looks like they're just doing their thing, I love this man, jeez. Good thing you stopped me, I came charging down the trail, making all kinds of sounds to scare bears, but. Uncle Bingo of course. You would have just took me out. I mean the cars are just right there, that's where the road is. And the bull moose and what we think is a cow. And we're pretty dang close to that bull moose right now. Let's see if I can... He's just right there, he's watching us. He's okay. He's alright. They really blend in if you're not watching. Yeah, they do don't they? As big as they are. Okay, this is what we're going to do. I'm going to film you. You run up, slap his butt, or spray paint it, and run as fast as you can. I'll tape the whole thing, this will be great YouTube footage. This will be like missing the Sasquatch a little bit. Okay, I'm in. Okay. We just forced him in the brush. Now see, I can't tell if he's eating or maybe... Look at this, maybe this is his bed. He's like, hey buddy. Get away from my bed. This is about as close as I dare get. We're probably 20 feet apart with a lot of brush in between us. He seems pretty calm. He's just gone about his business eating again. That's one thing I do, is really watch their body language. And understand where you are too. I know a lot of you guys tell me... I've had several guys in Alaska tell me, you could never do this. In Alaska with the moose that they have. Sorry guys, I'm not filming too well right now. I'm more watching him than trying to film him. Hey look, there's a baby. Awesome. Put him in your pack. What? Got straight up mauled by a cougar. Got on a buffalo. Buffalo sounds. We're approaching moose territory again. And this is our strategy. We've got plenty of sleeping bags. So if he charges us, we use the sleeping bag as a shield, punch him, wrestle him down, hog tie him. Good to go. I could do a drop kick to knock him over. That would be cool. We need to set up the camera though, so we can get it all on tape. Where's your action camera? Do you see that one? The bear one? That's freaking hilarious. He's right there, hanging out. He's the guy in the hat with the cool hat. Knock your hat, but it's not going to save you. Where he knocks the stove over. Knock the stove over on your foot. Ouch.\nComment: Eye to eye with the big guy!! Great vid brother!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Up backpacking with the kids and brother-in-laws Uncle Bingo and I had a close encounter with a Bull Moose. Returning to the car to gather extra gear for the kids at dusk, turned a bend on the trail and a bull moose was not too far off. I was in his comfort zone and he let me know it. Some very raw footage and just a snapshot of the trip. Also, Bingo and I having some fun talking about the youtube series \"Guy on a Buffalo.\" Personally I find it funny.Please visit \nTranscript: Let me set up this video for you. So I went backpacking, well, if you want to call it backpacking, with my kids, my brother-in-laws and their kids. Because we had so many young kids with us, we actually didn't go in very far at all. But we went in, found a spot, dropped all our stuff, and some of the adults stayed with the kids, and me and Uncle Bingo, actually, you've seen him in my films before, we went back down to the car to get the rest of the sleeping bags and that kind of stuff. But what happened is, I actually went down first. I kind of bushwhacked a little bit, you guys know how I like that, and then I hooked up with a trail later, and I was just, oh, I don't know, probably 50 yards ahead of him. And as I'm walking down, I'm almost to the street, and I notice a car was parked on the street right where our cars were parked, and it was just sitting there. I'm thinking, what is that car doing? As I walk and I come around this tree, I look over and there's a nice big old bull moose. And he's, well, he's not huge, but he's sitting there and he sees me come around the corner, he stops and he looks at me.

I love bobcats, and they're found throughout North America. Look at this one just chilling in a box. Bobcat in a box. Look, this one only has three legs! And you know what? His name is Howie. And he's a resident at the Wildcat Haven Sanctuary. Watch him just sip, sip, sip some water. He and others like him are rescued from assholes that think that they can maintain an exotic animal in their house. Look at this beautiful serval. Servals are amazing, but they're from Africa and the Sahara. So what's it doing here in beautiful Sherwood, Oregon? I'll tell you, as I was saying, many assholes out there think it's okay to raise an exotic animal. And they have no prior experience, and it's just horrible. So, they wind up here, thankfully, where they're well taken care of. And the Tuller family is doing an amazing job. This sanctuary is now open to the public, and they're provided with everything they need. Look, they're all just chilling! Bobcats, FYI, eat all sorts of nasty shit, I'm telling you, from rabbits to chickens. Oh, look at this! It's the Wildcat Haven Cougar Alley! Now, cougars are awesome, beautiful, big wildcats. Oh, hello there! Meow. This gorgeous baby is like, wait a second, do I know you? Now, the Wildcat Haven Sanctuary is home to bobcats, cougars, hybrids, lynx, servals, and tigers. It is an amazing organization, a non-profit, a no-kill sanctuary. Oh my goodness, and look how precious this cougar is! Hi sweetie, how are you doing? I'm fine, just chilling. You have any antelope on ya? This one just wants some tender vittles. Sniffing around, sniffing around. Meow. More like, roar! Oh, how gorgeous. Now, they also have these hybrids that you just saw there, where it's a mix between a wildcat and a domestic. Oh my shits-o, look at this tiger! It's coming right at me! Oh, how precious. Tiger just wants some rubs. Look how affectionate this baby is. Oh my goodness. And this is Nora, the Bengal tiger. Now, Bengal tigers get this way due to a lack of red and yellow pigments. Hello! And also, inbreeding promotes recessive traits, and having the lack of the orange is a recessive trait. And sadly, a lot of inbreeding is done just to, you know, continue this species. But they're gorgeous. All of these rescued wildcats are getting a new lease on life, thanks to the Wildcat Haven Sanctuary. The Wildcat Haven Sanctuary receives no state or federal funding, and they rely on funds from sponsors and donors like us. Please, do something. www.wildcathaven.org Click me now!

Oh, hello there! Meow. This gorgeous baby is like, wait a second, do I know you? Now, the Wildcat Haven Sanctuary is home to bobcats, cougars, hybrids, lynx, servals, and tigers. It is an amazing organization, a non-profit, a no-kill sanctuary. Oh my goodness, and look how precious this cougar is! Hi sweetie, how are you doing? I'm fine, just chilling. You have any antelope on ya? This one just wants some tender vittles. Sniffing around, sniffing around. Meow. More like, roar! Oh, how gorgeous. Now, they also have these hybrids that you just saw there, where it's a mix between a wildcat and a domestic. Oh my shits-o, look at this tiger! It's coming right at me! Oh, how precious. Tiger just wants some rubs. Look how affectionate this baby is. Oh my goodness. And this is Nora, the Bengal tiger. Now, Bengal tigers get this way due to a lack of red and yellow pigments. Hello! And also, inbreeding promotes recessive traits, and having the lack of the orange is a recessive trait. And sadly, a lot of inbreeding is done just to, you know, continue this species. But they're gorgeous. All of these rescued wildcats are getting a new lease on life, thanks to the Wildcat Haven Sanctuary.

The first shot was a little far back. Was she bedded down or was she standing there? She was bedded down.

Big Cat Rescue recently installed a solar power system thanks to the generous support of The Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, TECO-Tampa Electrical and Solar Energy Management. We're so happy that the sanctuary was given the opportunity to help save the planet by utilizing green energy sources and we hope to expand in the future!Check in on our solar power system here:  Energy Management:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Big Cat Rescue is going greeeeen! What? What does this mean? Oh. Big Cat Rescue decided to do our part to help save the planet by installing a solar power system. The installation was made possible by grants from the Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, and a solar electric rebate from TECO. The overall cost of the installation was $18,250. It took the team from Solar Energy Management around three days to install the system. They have to make sure that the solar panels are at the optimal angle so they can capture as much energy as possible from the sun. Throughout the installation, the team were constantly supervised by the cats. In particular, Joseph and Sasha. And, of course, TJ the tiger who was very interested in what was happening around him. For the projected 25-year life of the system, annual utility savings are expected to average around $1,542. So this will total to over $38,000 in savings. And just as importantly, carbon dioxide emissions that will be saved over the life of the system is projected at 157 tons, which is equivalent to driving 314,000 automotive miles. The sanctuary will be using the energy to power all of our pool pumps. So our tigers will have a place to cool off. Max the bobcat can take the occasional dip. And we can constantly replace the water that TJ splashes out of his pool. Plus, any excess power goes backwards through the electrical meter and is supplied to the main office building. Solar Energy Management generously donated two extra panels to the sanctuary. So instead of 20 panels, we have 22. And all 22 individual modules have their own microinverter underneath the panel. What's a microinverter, you might ask? And that's the box right here. And that's the box right here. So the advantages to the microinverter technology are if partial shading occurs or bird droppings fall on a panel and it degrades the performance of this panel, it doesn't affect any of the rest of the panels, so you can maximize power production. And the data collected by all 22 microinverters is transferred to the communication gateway, which then verifies that they're functioning and transmits the data, which is collected every five minutes, wirelessly to the main office where we can check on their status. You can actually monitor the output and production from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. On the webpage, you can check that all the panels are functioning correctly, see how much energy they've produced over different periods of time, and see the environmental benefits to date, such as how the energy could be used. And you can even see how many trees we've saved with our carbon offset. We're so pleased that we've been able to take our first step towards using green energy, thanks to the generous support of several organizations. Our solar panel system is also very easy to add on to, so we hope to do this in the future and continue to do our part for the environment. And I'm sure TJ will enjoy the entertainment.

Campers arrive every day and get to explore our 55 acre property, making sure they say hello to the cats and taking lots of photos along the way.

We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals.

Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans.

The sanctuary is a permanent home to over 100 rescued big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards. As well as smaller species like bobcats, servals, and sand cats. Campers arrive every day and get to explore our 55 acre property, making sure they say hello to the cats and taking lots of photos along the way. While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this. We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life. Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans.

The sanctuary is a permanent home to over 100 rescued big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards. As well as smaller species like bobcats, servals, and sand cats. Campers arrive every day and get to explore our 55 acre property, making sure they say hello to the cats and taking lots of photos along the way. While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this. We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life. Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans. They get to do lots of fun activities, like making Big Cat popsicles and learning about our operant conditioning program and why it's so important to the cats at the sanctuary. Then campers observe Big Cat keepers handing out the popsicles they made and the cats willingly participating in our operant conditioning program.

Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old.

Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old.

The bucks are the ones with the brown on their heads - the brown is staining from tree bark as they rub their antlers on trees.  They will be snow white again when they shed their winter coats.  They are not regulars in our neck of the woods so we didn't have the opportunity to see them with their antlers.  We sure would have loved to.  We did get a brief glimpse of the old buck with his wide, palmated antlers.  It seems that as the albino bucks age their antlers get thicker & thicker.  We learned shortly after this filming that the old buck (with the limp) was taken by wolves.  They only came around a few days but we sure enjoyed seeing them.

Is it rare to have so many albino deer in your area? There must be a law against shooting them as I assume they would be a lot easier to spot than a regular deer when there isn't snow on the ground. I also see there tarsal glands are stained brown. I would guess a regular deers tarsals are stained too but I've never noticed against there brown hide.

She was hit by a car a few weeks back, and if you wonder why I'm kind of talking low, well right behind me, a few acres back, that's our rehab area, and that's where Bellina and any other rehab bobcats we might get live before they're released, and she's going to go there. It's a very naturalistic enclosure. There's lots of places for her to hide. We have her, her enclosure's a little bit set up for handicapped animals, did just have all that surgery on her leg, so it enables her to get around. So even though Bellina looks a little bit freaked out right now, she's running up and down the side of the closure. That's actually a good sign for us. It means she doesn't want to be caged up. She wants to get out of captivity, and the good thing about our rehab area, it's a very quiet area. It's nice and isolated, so she's going to be able to peacefully recover from her surgery back there. She'll sort of relearn how to hunt with her repaired leg, and really, even though she's stressed out right now, or she seems stressed out, she's going to have a good, quiet recovery, and there's no way she's going to get accustomed to people. So in the rehab bobcat cage, we have a way to feed them remotely, so we can put the prey animals, which are usually live rats, we can put them in these tubes, and the tubes have several different splits, and they can end up popping up in any area of the cage, and we have this enclosure completely covered with old trees, logs, brush, a lot of places for the prey animal to hide, as well as for the bobcat to hide, so they really have to fine-tune their senses, watch out for these prey animals, and really, it gets them ready for release back into the wild. She's still being fed dead prey right now, but in a couple weeks, we'll be able to feed live prey through the tubes, so she'll be able to relearn how to hunt, relearn how to use that repaired leg. You might wonder how we are aware of the progress of our rehab bobcats, and actually, what we do is we have several remote cameras back there, so we can watch the rehab enclosure from all angles, and we never have people around the enclosure. This really gives us a great idea of how well the animal is hunting, if it's hunting, and really, how ready it is for release. It's pretty amazing, and we're keeping our fingers crossed that real soon, come spring, when there's lots of prey animals out there, she'll be healthy and healed, and we can release her back like we have the previous ones. You can help us change the way people treat big cats by texting TIGER to 20222.\nComment: @hummerwayo ahhhh, she was lucky not to have been hit, that must be one loyal animal to find you in a 5 mile radius, but if you do become inequipped to take care of it remember there are places that are able to. ;)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

She'll sort of relearn how to hunt with her repaired leg, and really, even though she's stressed out right now, or she seems stressed out, she's going to have a good, quiet recovery, and there's no way she's going to get accustomed to people. So in the rehab bobcat cage, we have a way to feed them remotely, so we can put the prey animals, which are usually live rats, we can put them in these tubes, and the tubes have several different splits, and they can end up popping up in any area of the cage, and we have this enclosure completely covered with old trees, logs, brush, a lot of places for the prey animal to hide, as well as for the bobcat to hide, so they really have to fine-tune their senses, watch out for these prey animals, and really, it gets them ready for release back into the wild. She's still being fed dead prey right now, but in a couple weeks, we'll be able to feed live prey through the tubes, so she'll be able to relearn how to hunt, relearn how to use that repaired leg. You might wonder how we are aware of the progress of our rehab bobcats, and actually, what we do is we have several remote cameras back there, so we can watch the rehab enclosure from all angles, and we never have people around the enclosure. This really gives us a great idea of how well the animal is hunting, if it's hunting, and really, how ready it is for release. It's pretty amazing, and we're keeping our fingers crossed that real soon, come spring, when there's lots of prey animals out there, she'll be healthy and healed, and we can release her back like we have the previous ones.

Mine's been reeeeaaaaaaally trying the the patience of everyone in the house the last two weeks.  I think my dog is plotting a way to rub her out without the blame being put on him.  I think locking her up in a big cage with a tiger or lion may very well put her in her place :P"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

She was hit by a car a few weeks back, and if you wonder why I'm kind of talking low, well right behind me, a few acres back, that's our rehab area, and that's where Bellina and any other rehab bobcats we might get live before they're released, and she's going to go there. It's a very naturalistic enclosure. There's lots of places for her to hide. We have her, her enclosure's a little bit set up for handicapped animals, did just have all that surgery on her leg, so it enables her to get around. So even though Bellina looks a little bit freaked out right now, she's running up and down the side of the closure. That's actually a good sign for us. It means she doesn't want to be caged up.

The white sticks out, so its chances of being seen by an eagle or a python, a mongoose, a rival predator, are so much greater. The normal coloured cubs, they blend with the forest floor, the leaf litter, the dappled light in the forest, they kind of disappear. The white cub sticks out like a beacon, very very vulnerable, and its colour makes it even more vulnerable. See the white tiger there trying to suckle on the other tiger, instinctive, gets no milk so immediately starts shouting. All three cubs now gone to sleep. Clambering over these rocks has taken it out of them, all their heads going down, little yawns, eyes closing, nice warm rocks, sun dropping now, temperature dropping, and they're all off for a nice little snooze. The number of sounds that I use to communicate with the cubs, I give a little purring sound, this is what a cheetah mother uses with her cubs, see how it calms them down, and then I use the little chuffing sound. See the other cubs are responding to the purr. Today the little cubs, just a month old, have had their first experience of water, and their first swimming experience. Now of all the big cats, tigers love the water the most. They live in areas where there are big monsoon rains, big rivers, and they will swim. In fact, in the Shundabans, they will swim 15 kilometers between the islands hunting for food. Watch how Shine helps Shunda climb out of the water. This is a typical den site that a tigress will use, nice little caves, and in here she can put these little cubs, get them into the crevices, and make it difficult for a rival predator to get inside. Now every few days, she will move those cubs to a new den site. When the scent builds up, the urine, the dung inside the den, it becomes smelly, and she takes the cub and moves it to a den site that she's found somewhere nearby.\nComment: Can I buy it"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The white sticks out, so its chances of being seen by an eagle or a python, a mongoose, a rival predator, are so much greater. The normal coloured cubs, they blend with the forest floor, the leaf litter, the dappled light in the forest, they kind of disappear. The white cub sticks out like a beacon, very very vulnerable, and its colour makes it even more vulnerable. See the white tiger there trying to suckle on the other tiger, instinctive, gets no milk so immediately starts shouting. All three cubs now gone to sleep. Clambering over these rocks has taken it out of them, all their heads going down, little yawns, eyes closing, nice warm rocks, sun dropping now, temperature dropping, and they're all off for a nice little snooze. The number of sounds that I use to communicate with the cubs, I give a little purring sound, this is what a cheetah mother uses with her cubs, see how it calms them down, and then I use the little chuffing sound. See the other cubs are responding to the purr. Today the little cubs, just a month old, have had their first experience of water, and their first swimming experience. Now of all the big cats, tigers love the water the most. They live in areas where there are big monsoon rains, big rivers, and they will swim. In fact, in the Shundabans, they will swim 15 kilometers between the islands hunting for food. Watch how Shine helps Shunda climb out of the water. This is a typical den site that a tigress will use, nice little caves, and in here she can put these little cubs, get them into the crevices, and make it difficult for a rival predator to get inside. Now every few days, she will move those cubs to a new den site.

Today Simon, the Founder of Wildlife Aid Foundation, was called out to rescue an adult Fox that was tangled up in a shed somewhere in Epsom.To his amazement, the lady opened the door to a very embarrassed looking fox who had come a cropper on a lawn mower's power cable!Simon struggled to understand just how the poor Fox could get so entangled in such a small piece of exposed cable. He did his best to restore the Fox's dignity and freedom, however the constriction on his leg was too bad and required treatment back at the wildlife hospital.As it's St George's Day we have decided to called the Fox St George (only for online referencing), however we can't see him slaying any Dragon's anytime soon!You can follow St George's progress on our Facebook page: www.facebook.com/wildlifeaidAbout TheWildlifeAidTVEver wanted to see the goings on behind the scenes at a Wildlife Rescue Centre? Well now you can! We have super cute hedgehogs eating their dinner, dramatic rescues of wild deer and everything in between.\nTranscript: Well, we've got a fox trapped in a shed and apparently he's trapped in some wire in the shed, so I'm not quite sure what kit we're going to need. Hello, do you have a fox trapped in a shed? Yes, it's a one hind leg, very tight. Is it? Yeah, he got so frightened up there. Well, I can see the injuries. He looks very tightly constricted by one of his legs. It looks incredibly tight. I don't really, he's mangy as well, which is a slight worry. What I want to try and do is grasp him so when I finish he can't leg it at great speed. All right, foxy dogs. How he's got stuck around that is absurd. I'm trying to get the fox out without damaging the lady's lawnmower, which is going to be quite interesting. I'm afraid he's already bitten through the mains cable by himself. There's nothing I can do about that. That was not me, I'm innocent. If I can get this handle off the lawnmower, that might give me a bit of slack to play with. Okay, now, I'm getting somewhere. That's it, now the pressure's off. All right, fella. You could have done this if you tried. Okay, he doesn't know it yet, but he's out. So before he knows he's out, I just need to get him grasped so he can't escape, which I've now done. Now I can move that out of the way. I can put the lady's lawnmower back together in a minute, but it has made the leg swollen, and because he's got mange anyway, he'll have to come back into the centre, and we'll see how much damage it's done to the leg. If it's been shut for too long, then obviously there's going to be a constriction problem. You tell them what one pot's contained without me being bitten. That's a bonus. Do they know how long he was stuck? Probably not more than overnight. I'm hoping there's not going to be a serious constriction. Toes are nice and warm. Yeah. Still very swollen. So what I'm probably going to do is shave that bit, so that we can really keep an eye on it. I'm not going to clip it right to the skin, just so that we can see what we're looking at, because sometimes these injuries take a few days to really show themselves. Having clipped it, you can really see how red it is. If this tissue dies here, then there's nothing you can do to stop it. So what we don't want to see is that going sort of black and hard tomorrow. I'm just going to put some of this lovely gel on it today. Just to keep it moist while the skin is hopefully healing. You can see the mange all around this area. It's really common to see it on the rumps of foxes. They quite often get sore patches over the bony hips as well. His heart's really slow. Wheezy as well. Well, he's having antibiotics anyway, for any secondary skin infections that they have from the mange, which is also going to help with his chesty breathing there. And then this is the treatment for the mange. They have to have this every week for three weeks. And then the final treatment will be a spot-on treatment before he goes free. Hopefully, if that leg's OK, we might only have to keep him a couple of weeks. Well, we've done all we can for now. He'll be with us two weeks. He'll be very lucky, probably three weeks, but he should go out in a lot better state than he is now. It's just a matter for the next 72 hours of keeping an eye on that wound, because that is absolutely critical. It's a tinny little house. How do you like it? The one in the corner's just non-stop stuffed his face since he got here. Like, oh, yeah, Liz's face is wicked. Ow! Ow!\nComment: Can you start sharing if these animals actually recover and are able to go free again? Or if they have to stay in care or unfortunately don't make it. I'm left wondering what has happened to this little guy. Thank you for showing the vets work as well.  You are such an amazing man to take care and save these animals from such scarry situations.

Today Simon, the Founder of Wildlife Aid Foundation, was called out to rescue an adult Fox that was tangled up in a shed somewhere in Epsom.To his amazement, the lady opened the door to a very embarrassed looking fox who had come a cropper on a lawn mower's power cable!Simon struggled to understand just how the poor Fox could get so entangled in such a small piece of exposed cable. He did his best to restore the Fox's dignity and freedom, however the constriction on his leg was too bad and required treatment back at the wildlife hospital.As it's St George's Day we have decided to called the Fox St George (only for online referencing), however we can't see him slaying any Dragon's anytime soon!You can follow St George's progress on our Facebook page: www.facebook.com/wildlifeaidAbout TheWildlifeAidTVEver wanted to see the goings on behind the scenes at a Wildlife Rescue Centre? Well now you can! We have super cute hedgehogs eating their dinner, dramatic rescues of wild deer and everything in between.\nTranscript: Well, we've got a fox trapped in a shed and apparently he's trapped in some wire in the shed, so I'm not quite sure what kit we're going to need. Hello, do you have a fox trapped in a shed? Yes, it's a one hind leg, very tight. Is it? Yeah, he got so frightened up there. Well, I can see the injuries. He looks very tightly constricted by one of his legs. It looks incredibly tight. I don't really, he's mangy as well, which is a slight worry. What I want to try and do is grasp him so when I finish he can't leg it at great speed. All right, foxy dogs. How he's got stuck around that is absurd. I'm trying to get the fox out without damaging the lady's lawnmower, which is going to be quite interesting. I'm afraid he's already bitten through the mains cable by himself. There's nothing I can do about that. That was not me, I'm innocent. If I can get this handle off the lawnmower, that might give me a bit of slack to play with. Okay, now, I'm getting somewhere. That's it, now the pressure's off. All right, fella. You could have done this if you tried. Okay, he doesn't know it yet, but he's out. So before he knows he's out, I just need to get him grasped so he can't escape, which I've now done. Now I can move that out of the way. I can put the lady's lawnmower back together in a minute, but it has made the leg swollen, and because he's got mange anyway, he'll have to come back into the centre, and we'll see how much damage it's done to the leg. If it's been shut for too long, then obviously there's going to be a constriction problem. You tell them what one pot's contained without me being bitten. That's a bonus. Do they know how long he was stuck? Probably not more than overnight. I'm hoping there's not going to be a serious constriction. Toes are nice and warm. Yeah. Still very swollen. So what I'm probably going to do is shave that bit, so that we can really keep an eye on it. I'm not going to clip it right to the skin, just so that we can see what we're looking at, because sometimes these injuries take a few days to really show themselves. Having clipped it, you can really see how red it is. If this tissue dies here, then there's nothing you can do to stop it. So what we don't want to see is that going sort of black and hard tomorrow. I'm just going to put some of this lovely gel on it today. Just to keep it moist while the skin is hopefully healing. You can see the mange all around this area. It's really common to see it on the rumps of foxes. They quite often get sore patches over the bony hips as well. His heart's really slow. Wheezy as well. Well, he's having antibiotics anyway, for any secondary skin infections that they have from the mange, which is also going to help with his chesty breathing there. And then this is the treatment for the mange. They have to have this every week for three weeks. And then the final treatment will be a spot-on treatment before he goes free. Hopefully, if that leg's OK, we might only have to keep him a couple of weeks. Well, we've done all we can for now. He'll be with us two weeks. He'll be very lucky, probably three weeks, but he should go out in a lot better state than he is now. It's just a matter for the next 72 hours of keeping an eye on that wound, because that is absolutely critical. It's a tinny little house. How do you like it?

Considering that the impala was 4 ft tall,  that branch where the leopard jumps from has got to be atleast 30 feet tall.  A jump from that height could severely bruise, fracture or kill us.  The way it dives its head upside down but yet lands on its feet is amazing use of the tail for balance and dynamics. Damn i can't believe this beautiful agile animal will be extinct from earth in the next 30 years."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: AH man ohio is the place to squirrel hunt I love it here went out for the first time this season today got me 4 nice fox squirrel already starting out the season good how about you??"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day.

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels.

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: great video,  very well edited.  I went out on the 12th as well it was too nice of a day not to!  we got a grey and a fox but then it started raining on us.  "},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

In this highlight, Forsberg describes his mission to catch a bobcat with a camera trap in Nebraska.-----A nature photographer and Nebraska native, Michael Forsberg shares his work documenting this vast landscape, its lakes, prairies along with its plants and animals.The Great Plains are a dynamic but often forgotten landscape -- overlooked, undervalued, misunderstood, and in desperate need of conservation. Forsberg's book helps lead the way forward, informing and inspiring readers to recognize the wild spirit and splendor of this irreplaceable part of the planet. - California Academy of SciencesMichael Forsberg is a Nebraska native and has focused much of his work in North America's Great Plains, once one of the greatest grassland ecosystems on Earth. His goal has been to try to capture the wild spirit that still survives in these wide-open spaces and put a face to the often overlooked native creatures and landscapes found there. His hope is that the images can build appreciation and go to work to inspire conservation efforts on the land far into the future.Forsberg received a degree in geography with an emphasis in environmental studies from the University of Nebraska, and worked briefly as a seasonal ranger in the National Park Service before accepting a job as a staff photographer and writer producing natural history stories for NEBRASKAland Magazine, the state's conservation publication. He worked at the magazine for six years before starting his own photography business and gallery.Forsberg's work has appeared in publications including Audubon, National Geographic, National Wildlife, and Natural History, and recognized in the Pictures of the Year and Wildlife Photographer of the Year competitions. In 2001, his image of a Nebraska tallgrass prairie was selected for an International Postage Stamp. In 2004, he was awarded a Conservation Education Award from The Wildlife Society. Recently, he was featured in the PBS documentary \"Crane Song,\" and was the 2009 recipient of the North American Nature Photographer's Association Mission Award.\nTranscript: For a TV, the world is thinking. For these four years, I tried to photograph predators like wolves, grizzly bears, mountain lions, bison, all these creatures that still just barely exist in certain areas of their range. And we were successful on all those except for a bobcat. So when the field work was all done, I went back home and we had about three or four months to get the book out the door. And somebody called me from a little prairie outside of my hometown in Lincoln, Nebraska and said, we think we've seen a bobcat. You can try to photograph your bobcat here. So what the heck? So I went out and I put this camera trap up along this game trail. Here's the camera in a waterproof housing. Right here is a transmitter and a receiver where an infrared beam is going across this game trail. And here's a little flash. And here's a little flash right here. So if something walks down here and steps over that log, in theory the camera should take a picture, right? For the first two months, this is what I got. Nothing. I don't know if it was the prairie fairies or if it was my friends playing tricks on me or what, but we didn't get any pictures of anything other than just nothing. And then, finally, after the turn of the year, we started to get photographs. Raccoon first. Bunny rabbit. Farmer Jones cat down the road. Farmer Jones dog down the road. Good job, California. I got a call in early March 2009 from my publisher, and they said, Mike, you got to pull the plug. Book's got to go off to print. You're done. I went out to pick up the camera traps. I had two pictures in the last deal. Here's the first one. And then an hour later, and it was really great to end with that photograph because that's the last picture that was made for this book. And it sort of creates the arc in the story for me because the look in that bobcat's eye is that same look that I saw in that burrowing owl's eye maybe 10 years earlier. The other thing was was that after traveling and being gone away from my family for all that time, I took this photograph 15 minutes from my home in a prairie that's been restored.\nComment: Is there some like campaign on YouTube to call all remotely interesting ForaTV videos fake? What is there in that to suggest it's fake? Maybe the camera made a noise or looked interesting and that's why the bobcat looked. Felines are curious and alert and can hear very well so if the camera makes the slightest sound before snapping the picture the cat will look. You people's comments are so useless and unfounded, especially McPrfctday's."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}
