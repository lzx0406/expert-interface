Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.

The biologist and hunters know more about this than any polotician. People need to understand what healthy numbers are, and what role people must play in this matter. What happens when they over populate? I asked and so I will answer for you. They starve, spread disease, and exterminate other species."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5.

Red-tailed Hawks are most often seen soaring high above the ground, looking for food. They are very difficult to identify unless they come closer to the earth.Red-tailed Hawks are large, stocky birds. They are brown with a white breast and a rust-colored tail.This hawk soars very high in the sky, hunting for food. They have excellent eyesight which is much sharper than a human's. A Red-tailed Hawk can spot a mouse from a height of 100 feet.These hawks also hunt from perches, usually alongside a field. Most of their prey are small mammals, including: mice, voles, shrews, moles, squirrels, chipmunks, rats, rabbits, opossums, muskrats, cats, skunks, and bats.music by Jason Shaw   Artist: AUDIONAUTIX.COM   Title: SERENITY\nTranscript: You You You Pretty That's something he's eating And roses ripping it apart I'm pretty big to what he caught Tail is hanging across the post These ripping pieces out of it Why I'd like to know what it caught because it's a pretty good sized thing I was throwing its guts out Doesn't like the guts He's getting big chunks now, oh that's taste good Oh Geez holy smokes It just about ate half the critter that it got.

Also in my opinion, the ex orphan mothers who were about to give birth traveled purposely back to their keeper's place, to their home unfortunately on their way,  they could not hold it any more and gave birth, that is the explanation why when they finally came at their home, their baby was just 1 day or a few days old. They were not far away. Of course when giving birth, they preferred that their newly born calves were safe from predators so home territory is the ideal place, surrounded by their keepers ( human family ) and other elephants.  Ex orphans learned that they could count on their human family..so they keep on coming back, visiting, introducing their kids, asking for help etc.. They are also teaching their youngsters and their wild elephant friends about it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

People at HESC literally dedicate their life for the animals well been! if you had spend any time with rhinos, instead of just point fingers at other people , u would understand that they move their years constantly, as their vision is not very good, as most of the ruminants, so they depend on their audition, that is way his years move a lot, it happens even when he is fast asleep different than elephants that open their years to make themselves big and show a sine that they are under stressed and may attack.\nIs to easy to just come and judge what other people r doing, way don’t u go read a little beat about rhinos, and how difficult is to rese a one of them, they need attention pretty much 24 hours a day, do u know how hard is to work the whole day, and at night spend a night at the stable waking up every 3 hours to feed Gertjie, do u know what is to be under the sun for 6 hours because Gertjie needs company? That is what the people At Hoedspruit Endangers species centre are doing, so please u that haven done any thing to help, don’t come here and say what u Think is write, is to easy to judge, the difficult thing is to take action and do some thing to save the rhinos as my friends at HESC are doing!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

The fact is that not a drop has been let through as of yet; the water is too polluted according to National Park regulations to run it south through the National Park. The question is if the water is flowed south will it be able to flow through the National Park the majority of the year? Now a 2.6 mile bridge is in sight, and additional 2.9 miles of bridging to proceed it. The problem we see is that the first 1 mile bridge has not yet been tested. The truth to the whole matter is, the Everglades biggest problem lies up north with pollution that should be corrected before spending taxpayers money on a science project that will be a permeant costly disaster if it does not work.We have studied the water flow patterns through the existing culverts for many decades. We have seen how the wildlife has been affected and have analyzed the situation as a whole. The ecosystem and wildlife is disappearing and suffering. Wildlife is becoming smaller in size, becoming weaker, and natural life spans are getting shorter. In 1998 a florida panther was found dead in Everglades Shark River Slough with levels of mercury so high it could kill an adult human.Right now and for the past several months before the 81 to 100 million dollar bridge was even finished water has actually been flowing through the National Park from south to north through the existing culverts; yes, backwards because the water is too polluted. Everyday a test by one of us has been conducted on the bridge to test the direction of the water flow. A hand full of sand is dropped at the opening, but it sinks straight to the bottom. If the flow of water was flowing south the sand would visibly be carried in that direction. Imagine 2.6 miles of water flowing backwards, (yes north) verses the culverts that are in place now. That equals a lot more water traveling north because water pollution regulations do not permit them to flow south through the National Park. Also sending water south would require permission from the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, which owns lands south of Lake Okeechobee and north of Everglades National Park. The Miccosukee Tribe is against the polluted waters being flowed into their land, and they are taking action to preserve their way of life. They would not be able to survive if the water and food is all poisoned. According to Earth Justice the pumps for polluted water on average contribute the equivalent of 60,000 one hundred pound bag of phosphorus to Lake Okeechobee each year.If the bridging is in place unnatural water depths will follow unnatural hydro-periods and water flow patterns. Now all the wildlife's hammocks will be under water, and there will be no dry land. This will result in unhealthy conditions. More water, more water, more water, is not the answer; Clean water, clean water, clean water, is the answer! Because of being in a hurry to build all these bridges that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars are we really going to sacrifice one environment to stop salt water intrusion down south into the bay? Remember there's only one Everglades and its all connected. All these bridges do not save the Everglades, they flood and pollute them more then they already are. We are affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. We have to treat the source of infection instead of covering it up with a bandaid.\nTranscript: Here we are west of the 2.6 mile bridge proposed area at the S333 lock. Water is not flowing into the Tamiami Trail Canal, the lock is closed. Here we are south of that lock. The water is traveling from the west to the east in the canal south of Tamiami Trail. These overflow pipes were located in this area and removed. When water levels would reach the height of the top of the pipe would flow into the pipe. They would act as an overflow and then flow water south into the canal, flowing the water into the National Park. The water now is flowing at a much more rapid rate into the National Park. The problem is it is making a U-turn and finding the path of least resistance due to sawgrass and a southern ridge. It is making a U-turn and flowing north instead of south. The opposite of what it is supposed to do. As the water flows north it travels through these pipes, culverts that flow into the Tamiami Trail Canal. This area is the center of the 2.6 mile proposed bridge. A bridge located here instead of the culverts would flow way more water north, completely drying out the south. You can see the rapid flow rate with three culverts. Imagine a bridge drying out and creating an unnatural drought south of the Tamiami Trail, interrupting the natural process of this part of the Everglades. Wildlife would suffer. Wildlife has already suffered enough due to over 25 years of held water in these areas and too much water and now more water is proposed, over 2 feet more in the canal. As of right now the National Park does not flow water south due to over 10 parts per billion of water pollution regulations. They have not been able to flow water south even through the one mile bridge. Here you can see water rapidly flowing north through these culverts, the area and center of this 2.6 mile bridge. This is not where the bridge should be located. During droughts this area has always flowed water north. Instead of here, the S3334 locks, when opened, create a suction that even increases drastically the water flow north from the south side, drying up the area even faster. Look at the flow going north into the Tamiami Trail Canal. The Everglades does not travel north, should not travel north. Man has interrupted water flows all over the entire Everglades and we are going to do it again with an irreversible situation and billions of taxpayer dollars. This is where the 2.6 mile bridge would be located. The locks at 3333 are closed. The water is traveling south down the L67 Canal making a U-turn and going back north you can see here on the map. The Blue Shanty, the new river, allowing large amounts of water flow north. This is the S3334 lock area. It is also closed. When opened and water flows south, this creates that suction, vacuum, dropping the water sometimes overnight or days, 6 to 8 inches. Unnatural, completely, not allowing the wildlife to adapt. This is not what is supposed to happen with the bridging. The bridging has to be thought about. The 1 mile bridge has not flowed a drop of water south ever since finished. The public has completely been misinformed. Taxpayer dollars are not at work. The 100 million dollar bridge has not worked. We have stopped and checked this area 3 to 4 times a week with a simple test. Water is not flowing in any direction and has not. When the lock is opened at the S333, it will flow south but sawgrass will clog the area restricting lots of flow. And again, taxpayer dollars will not be well spent. And right now, we must at least test the 1 mile bridge before creating more bad decisions. Another 2.6 mile bridge and maybe even more bridging. Bridge is not working right now. It has not for many, many months. The only way to make this water flow south is to create an unnatural level in the canal which will flow and flood the area, being detrimental and terrible for wildlife, especially mammal life. Heavy pollution coming from the north will kill aquatic life, affecting the food chain. This is not the Everglades restoration. This is the Everglades destruction.\nComment: Every time someone contacts the National Park for answers regarding this video they get the same general responses with no real answers.\n\nNational Park response #1) There is some localized northward flow just to the east of S333, because the water level on the west of the L67 extension levee is higher than water level on the east. \n\nNational Park response #2) The hydrology in the area is complicated, but we have been studying it for years and have a good handle on it.\n\nWhat they won't tell you because they can't is how are they going to stop the South side from drying up during times of drought, water pollution, or when lock #334 is opened because they need water? The answer is with a 2.6 mile bridge you won't be able to.\n\nPeople are finally starting to understand and it is very important for all of us to continue to watch & share this video as much as we can as we are the protecters of the Everglades."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

This is the Everglades destruction.\nComment: I had John from the Sierra Club write me an email. Below you can read his email, and my response to him. Seems like when ever someone enquires about this video they get the same generic response with NO REAL ANSWERS to the problem. \n\nBelow is the conversation.................................................................................................................................\n\nDear Mr. Harkness,\n\nThank you for contacting the Sierra Club. We took a look at your video and consulted with scientists at Everglades National Park. Your video actually demonstrates the need to restore flow across the central Everglades and elevate Tamiami Trail.\n\nAs you have documented, there is some localized northward flow just to the east of S333, because the water level on the west of the L67 extension levee is higher than water level on the east. Water levels are substantially lower in Northeast Shark Slough than western shark slough because of water management. This all part of the reason why we need to restore more natural flow by elevating the road. The net water flow through the culverts documented by the US Geological Survey since 1939 is north to south, and water will flow north to south as we redirect more water into Northeast Shark Slough under the 2.6 mile bridge.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJonathan Ullman\nSenior Everglades Representative\nSierra Club\n\nThe reply to the conversation.................................................................................................................................\n\n\nHi Jonathan\n\nI would like to thank you for writing me and taking the time to look into this.\n\nKeep in mind the entire time since the 1 mile bridge has been built water has not flowed South underneath it.\n\nHave Water Management and the National Park explain why they have not flowed water South? This is the first question we should have an answer too. We know it has not flowed South because we have checked it everyday since it's completion.\n\nIn the future when water is available we know the water will flow South. We agree with everybody about this point. But any time it is not flowed South the water will flow North due to not having enough water, being polluted, or during droughts. The bridges are going to allow the South Side to dry up in less than 24 hours during droughts and will cause a shock factor to local wildlife. Even during times when water is flowed South water levels will be so high that wildlife will not have land, and the excessive amounts of water will rot the vegetation destroying our ecosystem.\nThis leads to the second question that needs to be asked and answered. How does Water Management and National Park stop the Northern water flow underneath all this bridging when lock 334 opens and water is flowed South East of the lock, and when lock 333 is closed? This will create a vacuum suction drying out the South Side. A better solution they should look into is putting locks in the place of the 2.6 mile bridge area. This will prevent Northern water flow, and have more control over the water while achieving the Southern water flow in times of need. This scenario might not be as pretty as the view from the top of the concrete bridge, but it sure will save the South side of the Everglades from flooding, and loss of wildlife.This is not something you just slap together because you get some taxpayer money. \n\nSierra Club if you truly care about the Everglades you will get answers for these specific questions and scenarios."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

The fact is that not a drop has been let through as of yet; the water is too polluted according to National Park regulations to run it south through the National Park. The question is if the water is flowed south will it be able to flow through the National Park the majority of the year? Now a 2.6 mile bridge is in sight, and additional 2.9 miles of bridging to proceed it. The problem we see is that the first 1 mile bridge has not yet been tested. The truth to the whole matter is, the Everglades biggest problem lies up north with pollution that should be corrected before spending taxpayers money on a science project that will be a permeant costly disaster if it does not work.We have studied the water flow patterns through the existing culverts for many decades. We have seen how the wildlife has been affected and have analyzed the situation as a whole. The ecosystem and wildlife is disappearing and suffering. Wildlife is becoming smaller in size, becoming weaker, and natural life spans are getting shorter. In 1998 a florida panther was found dead in Everglades Shark River Slough with levels of mercury so high it could kill an adult human.Right now and for the past several months before the 81 to 100 million dollar bridge was even finished water has actually been flowing through the National Park from south to north through the existing culverts; yes, backwards because the water is too polluted. Everyday a test by one of us has been conducted on the bridge to test the direction of the water flow. A hand full of sand is dropped at the opening, but it sinks straight to the bottom. If the flow of water was flowing south the sand would visibly be carried in that direction. Imagine 2.6 miles of water flowing backwards, (yes north) verses the culverts that are in place now. That equals a lot more water traveling north because water pollution regulations do not permit them to flow south through the National Park. Also sending water south would require permission from the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, which owns lands south of Lake Okeechobee and north of Everglades National Park. The Miccosukee Tribe is against the polluted waters being flowed into their land, and they are taking action to preserve their way of life. They would not be able to survive if the water and food is all poisoned. According to Earth Justice the pumps for polluted water on average contribute the equivalent of 60,000 one hundred pound bag of phosphorus to Lake Okeechobee each year.If the bridging is in place unnatural water depths will follow unnatural hydro-periods and water flow patterns. Now all the wildlife's hammocks will be under water, and there will be no dry land. This will result in unhealthy conditions. More water, more water, more water, is not the answer; Clean water, clean water, clean water, is the answer! Because of being in a hurry to build all these bridges that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars are we really going to sacrifice one environment to stop salt water intrusion down south into the bay? Remember there's only one Everglades and its all connected. All these bridges do not save the Everglades, they flood and pollute them more then they already are. We are affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. We have to treat the source of infection instead of covering it up with a bandaid.\nTranscript: Here we are west of the 2.6 mile bridge proposed area at the S333 lock. Water is not flowing into the Tamiami Trail Canal, the lock is closed. Here we are south of that lock. The water is traveling from the west to the east in the canal south of Tamiami Trail. These overflow pipes were located in this area and removed. When water levels would reach the height of the top of the pipe would flow into the pipe. They would act as an overflow and then flow water south into the canal, flowing the water into the National Park. The water now is flowing at a much more rapid rate into the National Park. The problem is it is making a U-turn and finding the path of least resistance due to sawgrass and a southern ridge. It is making a U-turn and flowing north instead of south. The opposite of what it is supposed to do. As the water flows north it travels through these pipes, culverts that flow into the Tamiami Trail Canal. This area is the center of the 2.6 mile proposed bridge. A bridge located here instead of the culverts would flow way more water north, completely drying out the south. You can see the rapid flow rate with three culverts. Imagine a bridge drying out and creating an unnatural drought south of the Tamiami Trail, interrupting the natural process of this part of the Everglades. Wildlife would suffer. Wildlife has already suffered enough due to over 25 years of held water in these areas and too much water and now more water is proposed, over 2 feet more in the canal. As of right now the National Park does not flow water south due to over 10 parts per billion of water pollution regulations. They have not been able to flow water south even through the one mile bridge. Here you can see water rapidly flowing north through these culverts, the area and center of this 2.6 mile bridge. This is not where the bridge should be located. During droughts this area has always flowed water north. Instead of here, the S3334 locks, when opened, create a suction that even increases drastically the water flow north from the south side, drying up the area even faster. Look at the flow going north into the Tamiami Trail Canal. The Everglades does not travel north, should not travel north. Man has interrupted water flows all over the entire Everglades and we are going to do it again with an irreversible situation and billions of taxpayer dollars. This is where the 2.6 mile bridge would be located. The locks at 3333 are closed. The water is traveling south down the L67 Canal making a U-turn and going back north you can see here on the map. The Blue Shanty, the new river, allowing large amounts of water flow north. This is the S3334 lock area. It is also closed. When opened and water flows south, this creates that suction, vacuum, dropping the water sometimes overnight or days, 6 to 8 inches. Unnatural, completely, not allowing the wildlife to adapt. This is not what is supposed to happen with the bridging. The bridging has to be thought about. The 1 mile bridge has not flowed a drop of water south ever since finished. The public has completely been misinformed. Taxpayer dollars are not at work. The 100 million dollar bridge has not worked. We have stopped and checked this area 3 to 4 times a week with a simple test. Water is not flowing in any direction and has not. When the lock is opened at the S333, it will flow south but sawgrass will clog the area restricting lots of flow. And again, taxpayer dollars will not be well spent. And right now, we must at least test the 1 mile bridge before creating more bad decisions. Another 2.6 mile bridge and maybe even more bridging. Bridge is not working right now. It has not for many, many months. The only way to make this water flow south is to create an unnatural level in the canal which will flow and flood the area, being detrimental and terrible for wildlife, especially mammal life. Heavy pollution coming from the north will kill aquatic life, affecting the food chain. This is not the Everglades restoration. This is the Everglades destruction.\nComment: Kev Kilo Thank you for your reply Sir. Are you aware that when there is a drought or when the locks at #334 are opened the water flows from South to North underneath the culverts where the center of the proposed 2.6 Mile Bridge is planned to be built? "},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The 334 Lock on the East end of the L29 Canal was closed.\n\nHowever, we tested the water flow underneath the New 1 Mile Bridge and it was still not flowing South as it was intended to do even though the water table was raised.\n\nIt is great news that the water is flowing South today. The culverts radius is small and the water gets pushed through with pressure for it to travel South. This is a fact that Water Management knows about it. Another good thing about the culverts is you can block the water from flowing back North in case there is not enough water to send South, High Pollution, or in times of Droughts. If you put in place a 2.6 Mile Bridge you will have no way to control the water from coming back North. You also have to keep in mind when they open the 334 Lock to send water to the farms it's going to suck the water out from the South through the 2.6 Mile Bridge drying out the South side over night and there will be no way to stop it! \n\nHere are some questions taxpayers should be asking the Everglades National Park:\n\n1) Where will you get enough water to flow South all the time?\n2) How will you clean the water pollution fast enough?\n3) How will you stop the water from flowing back North when you do not have enough water or when it's polluted?\n4) Are you going to sacrifice the delicate Eco-System on the South side by drying it up overnight each time the farmer's need water?\n\nInstead of a bridge they should consider a lock to control the water or clear out the existing culverts and to put more focus on cleaning the water. "},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Dude, that... Stay on the stand. That may not be... That may not be... the biggest buck in the world, but I may have just shot the biggest buck of my life. With a bow, anyway. With a bow. How was the shot? I was in the brush. Dude... It sounded solid. Dude, I saw it penetrate right up to the fletches, man. I think I went in a little back, but he was quartered towards the front shoulder. I think it was a solid, solid shot. I don't think he went far. It didn't sound like it the way he was crashing. He was down. He didn't go... He didn't go far. I'll tell you what, he wasn't out long enough. You know what? I'm shaking with you, dude. I'm shaking with you, dude. That TruGlow pin, man, I'll tell you what, it's not very lighted out, and that thing just lit up right on his vitals.

We're going to take a couple minutes here, relax, let him lay, and go see what we got, see if we can put our hands on him. Whew! Well, we waited a little while. We heard him crash. We know he went down really quick. There's blood right at the scene of the crime. So we're just going to follow it out real easy here, and I don't think he went far.

Number 1) stay warm.  Nothin worse than trying to shoot a bow while ur cold.  Also, don't wear bulky clothes, they will interfere with shooting ... make sure to practice shooting with EXACTLY what you will be wearing so u know what to expect.  Other than that, watch the wind, ur scent, and aim small, miss small ... wait for the right shot ... it's not worth losing a deer over rushing a shot.   Best of luck!!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

In general, this specific posture normally indicates alarm or sexual responsiveness. Either way, it is probably not a good idea for a human to approach the animal if this signal is displayed.

This video was taken immediately following the charge and shows the aftermath of the mauling that never happened.\nTranscript: Okay, we're on Montague Island out of Port Chalmers and we're hiking up the mountain. We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around. I'm sure they're around.\nComment: @CyprusHot  Ok now you're bringing GOD in to this? Have some respect. And for your info. the LORD himself said to us to be the terror and fear of all animals (Gen)  So don't talk about GOD. And why is it that whenever I comment on these issues the name calling starts?  Who's ignorant here? Really, ask yourself. Have I called you names and insulted you in any way? Anyways the point is the Grizzly may have been protecting herself, and so did the humans.

I understand that Bears charge because they're afraid. I understand that. But when you passionately say \"they're just scared\" what do you suggest the people do then? Stand there and say \"Well, we are in their land, so I guess we'll have to let yogi here kill us.\" Don't you see that's absurd? Even if the humans WERE the trespassers, we still have the right to protect ourselves right?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide.

Also that verse is out of context because that verse is referring to an animal owned by some one (a domestic animal or cattle)as it says \"...cares for the needs of HIS animal...\" Therefore it does not apply to wild animals who are threatening humans. Also, in 1 Samuel 17:34-37 killing wild animals in self-defense is justified.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her.

If you get any of that spray on your hands and rub your eyes boy does it burn! I pepper sprayed a black bear in our carport this summer and some of the overspray got on the handlebars of my wifes bike. Had to scrub hard with soapy water to get it all off. Glad I noticed it before she did."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

It is obvious she only charged & attacked because she was doing what comes natural to her protect her babies at all cost - unfortunately you were forced to protect your own life @ all costs.

First off congrats you two are still alive.  Second there is no shame just shooting a charging bear.  There is no need to check off a list of bear spray or not. You have an animal capable and intending to rip you apart when they are charging. So shoot the damn thing between the eyes without batting an eyelash. If you survive to tell the tale, good for you.  So many are not so lucky.  Bears are not bad, they are bears, and they are wild.  There is no fairytale story.  If you are getting charged from a brown bear that is not a good thing at all for you. And yes mankind can still enjoy wildlife and these amazing creatures taking all precautions to prevent this type of thing to occur. Even with taking all necessary precautions, this can still happen. Thankfully the two here were prepared so they can live to tell the tail."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

You both had no right doing what you did. In this instance idc if she charged, it serves you both right!!! This is why bears are disappearing. And most likely you weren't even making noise you probably were quiet the whole time and the woofing was her warning and yet these bullheaded humans didn't heed it and she charged as a result. Then they turned on the camera and said let's upload a video to YouTube to cover our asses. Now two cubs have to go without a mother, I hope you live with that and see there faces every time you close your eyes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around.

This video was taken immediately following the charge and shows the aftermath of the mauling that never happened.\nTranscript: Okay, we're on Montague Island out of Port Chalmers and we're hiking up the mountain. We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore.

First released by Captain Cook for a food source for the pioneers of this country, the Feral Pig has thrived in our conditions and multiplied to almost plague proportions. Up here in the territory, the good living has seen the Feral Pig population explode. Cape York is probably the first destination most people think of when they think of pig hunting, but up here in the territory, their numbers are just as strong. I've heard of boars up to around 240 kilos being caught in the territory, but between 80 and 100 kilos is a good sized boar. They are an environmental terrorist, destroying vast tracts of land. In the south, they destroy crops and livestock, decimating the income of our already struggling farmers. Up here in the north, they tear our wetlands and national parks to shreds. No wetland has been left untouched. They act as carriers of weeds and exotic diseases, and they tear up the land until it becomes a mess of impassable pig ruts. Anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of driving across them will know what I mean. With a keen sense of smell, excellent hearing, and razor sharp tusks, pigs can be considered as dangerous game. Wounded animals are especially dangerous, and I've had a few close calls with wounded boars. There seems to be a lot of difference in opinion on what is the best calibre of hunting pigs. My opinion is, if it kills them, use it. I've shot them with everything from a .22 to a .375 Ultramag, but the latter can get quite expensive when you look at how many pigs we have up here. The smaller calibres can have problems penetrating the thick fighting pads and mud on the larger boars, so aiming at the base of the ear is your best bet when shooting with a small calibre. When using the bigger calibres, aiming tight behind the shoulder has always yielded good results for me. Herds of 30 or more are not uncommon. A group of animals this large will destroy a patch of dirt bigger than a football field every single food sitting. The feral pig is a real menace, and we as hunters need to do our part.\nComment: Hey Karl watch out boy just see the tusks and the size of them can’t take the dogs no count only machine gun can stop them"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Visit the official BBC Earth channel:  EarthThe BBC Earth YouTube channel is home to over 50 years-worth of the best animal videos from the BBC archive. With three new videos released every week there’s something for all nature loves from astounding animal behaviour to beautiful imagery. Click here to find our more:  secret camera is hidden in a Hornbill nest before the jungle bird blocks the entrance for hatching. Fascinating insight into the private life of these colourful birds from BBC wildlife show 'Jungle'.This is a channel from BBC Studios who help fund new BBC programmes. Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: For hornbills, finding the right tree is crucial to survival. They need a roomy nesting hole, usually made when a large branch falls off a mature tree, which doesn't happen very often. Scientists have installed surveillance cameras into nest holes like this, to get an intimate, kind of big-brother view into the private lives of hornbills. These unique pictures show a female hornbill making herself at home. She needs to feel as comfortable as possible, because she's going to be a prisoner in here for up to four months. Once in, she starts preparing to seal up the door. She's plugging the entrance with mud, pieces of wood and sticky fruit, and leaving just a very narrow slit. And the reason why she shuts herself away is to lay her egg and protect her chick. From now on, she'll depend entirely on her partner to survive. He makes about ten or more runs a day, bringing back about a kilogram of food, a varied diet of fruit, insects, small reptiles and young birds. He stores it in his throat, and once back at the nest, regurgitates it for his family. With such intensive care, the chick grows fast, and eats mum out of house and home. After five weeks, there's only room inside the hole for him. Once a pair have found their ideal home, they'll keep on coming back for years. So trees like this are critical to the survival of these endangered birds. If this nest isn't available next year, this chick's parents may never find another.\nComment: .... I wonder if it would be possible to build a nest for the Horn Bill and would the birds use them.........We might be able to attract the birds with plenty of food and water and their own credit card. We live in the mangroves located about 2 or 3 hours by motobike and boats from Koh Kong Cambodia. There are flocks of Horn Bill birds here. I have no idea where they roost at night. Maybe a hotel...............If the chicks grow up in a home made birds nest, they might return next season."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

It didn't matter to you if you made a clean kill or not, you just took a chance.  It would be different if it was already wounded and you were trying to put it down to take this shot.  If you are going to post a video, get a tripod or learn to hold the camera still."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

It's good to start them when they're young like this because when they get older then this is just a natural occurrence. It's an everyday occurrence for the lions. Reason being is it gets them out of their enclosures to get to explore their environment, smell new smells, sense new things. Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, it sounds like it. It sounds like it. Yeah. So this walk is really important for them in terms of mental and physical stimulation, especially a lion like Georgie. As you can see the way he walks, he still walks a little bit bow-legged. And he had quite severe metabolic bone disease when we got him, when he was rescued from Spain. Yami has fared a bit better, but also is not quite the size that he should be for a lion of that age. They're both coming on nine months now, and they're both incredibly small for their age. Yeah. Oh, almost. Almost. Yeah. No, Yami. Give him a chance. Yeah. You can use my back. Use my back. There we go. There we go. Don't say I don't love you. So I hope you enjoyed your walk with Georgie and Yami. If you subscribe and join us, you can come on more of these walks and see these two guys grow up and join them on their adventures as they become big lions. Join us next time on a walk with Georgie and Yami. .\nComment: I will never get over how beautiful these animals are,  and how beautiful the bond that you have with them is.  It still amazes me.

What a lot of people don't realize is the abuse that builds up to allowing that elephant to allow you to mount its back and to ride it. Many female elephants, when they give birth, they will actually kill their calves. And I feel that that is because they know what kind of life that baby is going to have and they don't want the baby to go through it. So they would rather just kill it as soon as it's born. It's a chain of cruelty that we have to stop right now. And the people who can stop it are the tourists coming to Thailand. They are the ones with the power. I am Catherine Connor, the founder of Bunlok Elephant Sanctuary Bless in Sukhothai, Thailand. Here, our number one priority is the elephant's welfare. We're not interested in profit. We're not interested in keeping the tourists happy. We just want to make a difference to the lives of these abused elephants. The rhythm here is beautiful. It's slow. We work on elephant time. You know, when the elephants want to go, we follow. If they want to stop and graze, we wait. And I think that for a lot of people who come here, it's a whole different world. It's a whole different way of looking and dealing with life. And I think that we change people when they come here. Here we have Phang Noi and Phang Soi. And behind you, you have Wassana, Lotus and Phang Dao. And they are collectively known as the Gossip Girls because they are non-stop trumpeting, roaring, squeaking, purring. You see, normally the cameras are all on them. People are wondering when it's going to be their turn. I have always had a passion for animals. And when I came to Thailand, I knew I wanted to see elephants. I began to volunteer at an elephant center in North Thailand. And I met a baby elephant called Bunrot, which is Thai for survivor. That baby elephant reached out and touched me. He changed my life forever. If he hadn't have died, I'm not sure I would have created BLAST because I would have just all my attention and all my focus and all my funds would have been going on to him. Elephants in Thailand, they were always held in very high regard. They were used for logging. And in 1989, Thailand banned that. And so what happened was thousands of elephants and their owners were unemployed. So what do they do? They're not going to give up their elephant. They need to provide for their family. That is when elephant tourism was born. Elephants are forced to perform tricks and the training that goes on to achieve that is diabolical. They're put through a breaking process. The baby elephant is stabbed repeatedly and beaten repeatedly until the spirit is broken. What it then becomes is a machine for the tourist trade. This is Bunthong. We found her in a tourist camp in Pattaya, giving trekking rides. So that means she had that big heavy chair on her back. As a result of years of doing that, she has a broken back. This is Wassana. She stood on a landmine when she was illegally logging on one of the Thai borders. Despite the fact that she is missing parts of her front foot, she was still sold into the tourist trade and forced to give rides. I mean at the end of the day, I don't think any of us are cruel. And I think most of the cruelty that goes on with elephants in Thailand is lack of education. I think most of these elephant owners don't know the damage that they're doing to their elephant's spine and joints. If they knew, I would hope that they would stop. At Bless, we have three guest houses that sleep two people each. We charge people to stay here. We have no programme, no schedule. We never encourage our guests to approach the elephant, encroach on their space. Our vision is to rescue the abused elephants, to recuperate them, to teach them how to be elephants again and then to release them onto protected land where they can live as wild elephants again. One of the biggest things for me, the thing that amazes me about them the most, is their ability to forgive. You know, these elephants, all of them have been abused by us, by humans. And yet, here they are, comfortable, accepting us, allowing us into their space, allowing us to walk along beside them. I just find that incredible.\nComment: 2020 when Covid-19 pandemic has occurred that brings many change to the elephants in Thailand in better way.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: All animals are amazing! Even flys are a part of the ecosystem they are here for a reason. Hunting something so important will not be good for the earth and just really, how, just why would you?

Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: Does BCR have any contact with Kevin Richardson in South Africa?

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: o my god they are still doing thous bad thing to thous cat man is just bad hunters shound be jailed for killing the big cat wants with man the way i see i we are just to big so get out off the land of big cats is there home is been there home for millines of yers long be for men heres want i think tar down the cat farms and sent he big cats free and lock up the hunters for life stop selling poison to man so no on will be killed no more man in big cat lands is best."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: @my35Xvision Thanks You! I'm happy you liked it so much :-) I to would of liked the video to be much longer. I would of liked to of stopped and filmed the whole heard of Buffalo going past but there are to many cars to hold up and the Buffalo kept coming and coming so it could of been a long while before they were all passed.

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: Fantastic video! - too short though.... It is such a great picture of Buffaloes crossing the road and roaming free on beautiful land and all other wild animals seen here. It is breathtaking to see all of it. It looked like one of the buffalo's head was injured. And also there were so many young buffaloes - so wonderful!

Well what Kai does is he's actually got a big mud bath in his enclosure. It's pretty cool. He gets a bit dirty. Sometimes when he has that mud all over him, he loves it if you can just pick it off and scratch. It just kind of feels like a massage. They have that mud on their back to help them as like a sunscreen and a mosquito repellent. They actually can't see really well. But Robert, what can they do? They have really, really good hearing. And what's funny about Kai is if you look just on his ears, he's got those little tufts of fur. Isn't that silly? We're not really sure why he has it. Maybe it's to keep the dust out of his ears. This is the white rhino. And they're different from their cousin, the black rhino, for a few different reasons. Firstly, these guys are grazers. So if you look at their mouth, they have that real rectangular shape and really big squishy lips. That's because they eat things like grass. But if you compare them to their cousin, the black rhino, they have a more triangular shaped mouth, don't they? Yeah. It's really pointy. And do you know why they have that? That's because they eat different foods. It's true. So they eat more like things like shrubs. Yeah, so rhinos can actually grow up to be two tons. They're really, really heavy. It's true. Now, the poor rhinos are in a lot of trouble. They're actually critically endangered because of that gorgeous horn. That horn is made out of keratin, which is the same as our fingernails. What people do is they'll kill the rhinos for that horn to turn it into traditional medicine. The biggest thing to protect rhinos or any wildlife is to never, ever buy wildlife products.

There were a few notices put up by the hotel indicating that wild animals are not to be fed. Since this squirrel looked rather tame and more familiar with the surroundings I thought of giving it a banana :) May be it was used to the hotel guests feeding it. I was very close and was able to admire it while it was feeding itself. The surrounding of the resort hotel chalet where we stayed was rather interior and was bordering a Wildlife Sanctuary. Grizzled Giant Squirrel - (Ratufa Macroura) ================================= The grizzled giant squirrel is a large tree squirrel found in the highlands of Sri Lanka and India. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as near threatened due to habitat loss and hunting. Countries - Native - India , Sri Lanka Taxonomic Notes - There are three very distinct subspecies, with one present in India and all three present in Sri Lanka. Red List Category & Criteria - Near Threatened Justification - Listed as Near Threatened because this species is probably in significant decline due to habitat loss and hunting throughout much of its range. Range Description - This species is endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. In India it is known from only five severely fragmented locations, while it occurs more widely and less fragmented in Sri Lanka. Population - The Indian population has been estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals, and the population has been decling due to habitat loss and hunting The population of this species is considerably higher in Sri Lanka. Habitat and Ecology - It is a diurnal and arboreal species. It occurs in tropical dry deciduous and montane forests, where it is confined to the riverine habitats. It has a generation time of ~7-8 years. Major Threats- Habitat loss and degradation due to agro-industry farming, small-scale logging, selective logging, increase in human settlements, forest fire, inter-specific competition, competition from alien species, hunting for local consumption purposes, presence of domestic predators have been observed to be the major threats for this species. The grizzled giant squirrel's common name came from the grey to brown colouration highlighted with white at the top of the tail, giving it a grizzled appearance. The rest of the body varies in colour geographically and may be brown, red, grey or black, but the fur on the underside is always lighter than the back. This agile climber is adapted for life spent almost entirely in the trees, and has a very long tail for balance, broad hands for climbing and large claws for gripping branches. The ears are short, round and sometimes tufted.Music By Lohstana David from Jamendo .com\nTranscript: \nComment: I enjoyed watching this squirrel, while it was feeding on the banana. I love its face - so cute, especially in close-up range. Like all squirrels it looks so adorable. I love the munching part with the music - so funny... It's really a big one  squirrel and very unusual in this respect. It cannot be as fast as other small squirrels are and it could be a problem for surviving. Thank you for this wonderful video.

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: I'm on the southern edge of the Namib Desert. Here, plants can't get water not because it's frozen, but because rain hardly ever falls, only about one or two inches in the whole year. Most of the time, it's bone dry and devastatingly hot. Yet, almost unbelievably, there are trees standing out in the sands, totally unsheltered, with no sign of moisture anywhere around them. Water storage is the great trick here. These green succulent leaves are full of it, and so are these bloated branches. The local bushmen used to cut off these branches and hollow out the spongy tissue and use them as containers for their arrows, which is why this tree is called the quiver tree. Its branches are covered with a blindingly white powder which reflects the heat, and its leaves have thick rinds with very few pores, which minimizes the amount of water they lose through evaporation. The trunk, even of an old tree ravaged by the years, remains smooth and impermeable, but even the quiver tree can't seal itself off totally from its surroundings. Living involves breathing, and some water vapour is inevitably lost in that process. But this tree has a way of reducing that. Self-amputation. It can cut off a leaf rosette and seal the stump. This branch will never grow leaves again, but with luck, the tree will just survive with a reduced number of leaves and put out new shoots when conditions improve.\nComment: Self amputation!?\nOuch. ;<"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Flavio is a retired circus tiger and to the best of our knowledge he's 23 years old! This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Happy Birthday Flavio!\nObviously, you guys take very good care of your cats, but it looks (and sounds) like the circus the cats performed at took care of them as well?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints.

At first I was crying because of the horrible cruelty and exploitation that these beautiful cats have experienced, but then I started crying tears of joy that Flavio (and all of the other critters that are in your care) finally gets to experience the beauty and happiness that they deserve. Although it is sad that Flavio isn't here on earth with us anymore, it is so very comforting that he got to spend his \"retirement years\" in a place where people loved and cared for him and made his life so enriching and happy. You can see the joy in his eyes when he is running around and playing, like he finally was able to be a tiger. I am so grateful that there are people like those at Big Cat Rescue who dedicate their time and lives to give these extraordinary animals the happiness and respect that they deserve."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

I would love to see people that capture and keep beautiful wild creatures like those in cages .... and those that support it and think it's 'cute' . .be forced to live the same way.

That's the pond pulled to bits, we've removed the large stones from around the side, we've kept them fairly local, just tipped them over the back there to allow us to reshape the top shelf, we've whipped the liner out, there was a little bit of underlay in, carpet underlay, probably covering about 20% of the pond, so it was there as a token gesture, no more, we've dragged the cobbles back a little bit, that'll allow us to build a proper shelf here to retain the cobbles and then just push them back in so they don't need to be moved twice, same with the stones, once we get the shelves done around the sides we'll just be able to lift the stones back into position and cement them in. Right this morning we've reshaped the pond, we've dug the shelves a little bit deeper all the way around the edges, we've created a new shelf around here, the idea being to put a little bit of cement all the way along here, cement in some of these fellas and then pile the rest behind it to prevent them falling in. We've made this inner shelf around here a little bit taller, i.e. a little bit nearer the surface because there wasn't much space for putting marginal plants before, that shelf was pretty deep, it was about 18 inches, which is no good for most plants, we've made another little shelf in the bottom here and we've basically just flattened everything out, ready for the underlay. That's the underlay in now, more or less went in in two long sheets, that's one sheet, that's another sheet, we've sealed it with a heat gun, basically just put a little bit of fire between the two layers and pressed them together in this stick. So now it's time for the liner. That's the liner in now, it's one mil rubber, Firestone liner, we've started filling it up, we're probably going to fill it up until it's just over this shelf here, that should pull the liner in enough for us to work on this top shelf, cementing the stones in. It's pretty important to fill it up sufficiently so it pulls the liner in and makes it tight, otherwise if you just bray on and put the edging stones on when the liner's loose, when you fill it up, it can pull the edging stones in and make a real mess. This is the edging just about half done, we're putting a little ring of cobbles cemented in around the beach edge here, then we can cut the liner off, pour the cobbles back over that and it retains the cobbles quite nicely. We've gone round the sides with stone, well gone halfway round the side with stone, obviously the water's still got quite a long way to come up, but we're going to stop it just shy of those stones there, just in case we get any rain overnight, we don't want it to affect the cement that we've put on. All these gaps will be filled in with soil and then we'll cut the liner off. It's coming together quite well. It's the end of today, we've cemented all the edging stones on, put the cobbles back in position, had a bit of a tidy up around the edges, the water's still got to go up by 8 or 9 inches or so to cover the exposed liner there, but we're leaving it at this level just so it doesn't interfere with the cement. So really now all there is to do is just leave it for a couple of days, top it up and then get the video of the finished pond. That's about it. We've filled the pond up to about 6 inches below its full level, that's to allow the cement that we put around here to go off properly, that was the last bit of cementing that we did, so it'll still come up, probably halfway up these stones that surround the pond here. It's reasonably clear because most of it is water straight out of the tap, although we did put a little bit of pond water back in, it was probably about 300-400 litres went back in.

That's the pond pulled to bits, we've removed the large stones from around the side, we've kept them fairly local, just tipped them over the back there to allow us to reshape the top shelf, we've whipped the liner out, there was a little bit of underlay in, carpet underlay, probably covering about 20% of the pond, so it was there as a token gesture, no more, we've dragged the cobbles back a little bit, that'll allow us to build a proper shelf here to retain the cobbles and then just push them back in so they don't need to be moved twice, same with the stones, once we get the shelves done around the sides we'll just be able to lift the stones back into position and cement them in. Right this morning we've reshaped the pond, we've dug the shelves a little bit deeper all the way around the edges, we've created a new shelf around here, the idea being to put a little bit of cement all the way along here, cement in some of these fellas and then pile the rest behind it to prevent them falling in. We've made this inner shelf around here a little bit taller, i.e. a little bit nearer the surface because there wasn't much space for putting marginal plants before, that shelf was pretty deep, it was about 18 inches, which is no good for most plants, we've made another little shelf in the bottom here and we've basically just flattened everything out, ready for the underlay. That's the underlay in now, more or less went in in two long sheets, that's one sheet, that's another sheet, we've sealed it with a heat gun, basically just put a little bit of fire between the two layers and pressed them together in this stick. So now it's time for the liner. That's the liner in now, it's one mil rubber, Firestone liner, we've started filling it up, we're probably going to fill it up until it's just over this shelf here, that should pull the liner in enough for us to work on this top shelf, cementing the stones in. It's pretty important to fill it up sufficiently so it pulls the liner in and makes it tight, otherwise if you just bray on and put the edging stones on when the liner's loose, when you fill it up, it can pull the edging stones in and make a real mess. This is the edging just about half done, we're putting a little ring of cobbles cemented in around the beach edge here, then we can cut the liner off, pour the cobbles back over that and it retains the cobbles quite nicely. We've gone round the sides with stone, well gone halfway round the side with stone, obviously the water's still got quite a long way to come up, but we're going to stop it just shy of those stones there, just in case we get any rain overnight, we don't want it to affect the cement that we've put on. All these gaps will be filled in with soil and then we'll cut the liner off. It's coming together quite well. It's the end of today, we've cemented all the edging stones on, put the cobbles back in position, had a bit of a tidy up around the edges, the water's still got to go up by 8 or 9 inches or so to cover the exposed liner there, but we're leaving it at this level just so it doesn't interfere with the cement. So really now all there is to do is just leave it for a couple of days, top it up and then get the video of the finished pond. That's about it. We've filled the pond up to about 6 inches below its full level, that's to allow the cement that we put around here to go off properly, that was the last bit of cementing that we did, so it'll still come up, probably halfway up these stones that surround the pond here. It's reasonably clear because most of it is water straight out of the tap, although we did put a little bit of pond water back in, it was probably about 300-400 litres went back in.

And it looks great. I think it's going to be a perfect night. We're going to get in, let things settle down, and we'll hope for the best. He's right there. Right there. He's not walking right. Perfect buck. He's going to drop his head real low every step. Dude, that was perfect. 20 yards right out of the wood line. Bush in the bag, baby. Ground blind. Perfect. Perfect. He's 100 yards. Perfect. Lunged him. Those TrueFire broadheads, Switchblade broadheads, fly like field points. There is no better flyer right now. Amazing. Awesome. What a buck. Had a limp. Great buck to take this time of season. Got my Zero Detect camo on, camo suit. I mean, goes perfect. It's early season. This brownface in the early season is perfect. You can skyline it. You can be on the ground. Couldn't ask for anything better. I can't thank Gibbs Archery Gear enough. Have you guys seen this bow sling that they got? It's better than anybody else's out there. Let's go find it. We shot this buck late in the evening, and we lost light. So I called Mike and helped him come out here and follow the blood trail. That's where we're at now. We're not too far away. We had a good frost last night, so it was able to freeze a lot of the blood on the leaves and in the soybean field. We've been able to track it very easily up until it got into this thick cover. I think we're pretty close. It's starting to clot up. We're finding it about every 10 yards, finding spots of blood, so it should be real close. Let's head down this way. Still on it here. I don't want to have to work along this bank. He's in the water. That's got to be my deer right there laying in the water. We're going to have to come up with a plan to get this thing out of here. I got a couple hooks on this. I think I can get him. He's maybe 17, 18 inches wide. Not a huge buck. But with that limp, he was a great buck to take. I mean, he's exactly what we were looking for out here. That's a good buck. Your second Ohio buck? This is my number two Ohio buck, yeah. Awesome deer. Yeah, I'm happy. Great way to find it, fishing it out of the water. This is the second deer I had head to water in Ohio, too. He's awesome. The hard part's done. We got him out of the water. Now I can just drag him on out. Get the four-wheeler down here and get him out of here. Alright, thanks man. No problem. Congratulations. That's awesome. you\nComment: i seen a doe this year mid summer with the back right leg completely snapped and it was strugglin i had to take it"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Its only problem is that they can't run for long. Their body is not strong enough to take a one mile run. I watched a show on Discovery Channel a few years back and a cheetah actually died from running too much. They used one of those infrared cameras to measure body temperature and the cheetah's body heats up too fast and that's why they must stop soon.

It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection. It's just something that we've been doing for a long time. We're very passionate about our care for animals and we want to share that with everyone.\nComment: I want to see one running FULL SPEED.

On 08.03.08, this storm hit the US midsection during a year which already had bad storms. The storm is shown in another video, Great Blizzard 2008, Record Breaking, Storm of Century,  video was made one day afterwards. The wildlife were getting hungry. Here two doe and two fawns come up to the bird feeder (they generally inspect it after dark). Although they were very hungry, they were even more curious about the cat. Deer do not appear to understand what domestic animals are and are exceedingly curious.The cat was curious also. The deer kept their distance, but spent some time looking over the cat. One fawn seemed to not be in the best of a mood. It hit its mother with a hoof at least twice (at ~ .46 and 1.2).The deer kept getting closer to the cat by hiding behind the snow drift, then going back to the tree. The snow was so deep that the deer could hardly run through it, when they left.The previous Video begins with view of field and trees taken immediately (~1-2 days) before the storm. Wildlife includes whitetail deer (which are loosing their antlers), wild turkeys, turkey vultures (sighted here for first time of year), and crows. Video then shows blizzard beginning at night. Nighttime animals out included raccoons (only 1 was photographed) and a coyote. These animals were videotaped in infrared. The  storm was getting bad during the coyote filming. Video then shows view of the storm. Only the closest trees were visible during the whiteout, as compared to the normal view of the area. Small snow whirlwinds, tornados, and gusts traveled across the landscape. Snow was cleared here with backhoe.The record breaking snow fall was 20.4 inches. The previous mark in Ohio for snow during 1 storm was 15.3 inches. And this record was made in 1910. Blizzard was compared to the famous blizzard of 1978. Streets were closed, a snow emergency was declared, and plane travel stopped (although I heard a jet while I was filming the coyote). A level 3 snow emergency was declared in many counties. Freeways were closed. Cities had parking bans. Contingents of several snow plows pulled through, some slid off the road. Many accidents occurred. People intending to vacation in warm places were stuck in Ohio.After the storm traffic was still stopped. The streets were used for sledding and snowboarding.Additional views of wild deer on the farm include:LARGE BUCK FIGHT-LOCK ANTLERS, ENTANGLED, CLOSE WHITETAIL  Non-Typical Moose-Sized Buck DEER - ACTION SHOTS RARE WHITE WILD WHITETAIL BUCK  views of this white deer: white deer on the farm -- the banded one & sibling: white deer being stalked by coyotes: strange deer on the farm deer fighting bucks run and jump bucks fighting COYOTES VS.

The hyenas moo to show affection like a cat purrs.  Then they laugh when getting ready to eat.   They are one of the most intelligent and powerful animas in the world.  Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not.

But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

The hyenas moo to show affection like a cat purrs.  Then they laugh when getting ready to eat.   They are one of the most intelligent and powerful animas in the world.  Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with.

Watch as wildlife managers count Mexican wolves to find out if 2014 is a record-breaking year. This video was created by the Information Branch of the Arizona Game and Fish Dept. Producer: David Majure.\nTranscript: December 2014 in the White Mountains of Arizona, a trail cam placed near the carcass of an elk records a pack of Mexican wolves showing up for breakfast. It's nothing unusual, yet it's absolutely extraordinary, especially when you consider that Mexican wolves nearly became extinct. By the early 1970s, there were zero wild Mexican wolves in the United States, and only a smattering could still be found in Mexico. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Mexican wolf as an endangered species in 1976. Today, Mexican wolves are making a comeback in Arizona and New Mexico, thanks to a captive breeding program and a reintroduction project that's been releasing and managing wolves since 1998. It's a partnership between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the Forest Service, the White Mountain Apache Tribe, and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. From the get-go, the goal was a self-sustaining population of at least 100 wolves by 2006. It's taken us almost 10 years after that to even come close to that number. Go find a location on RIM, go find Tsewa, only you're going to be over there on White Mountain. Jeff Dolphin is team leader for Arizona Game and Fish on the interagency field team, which does the day-to-day management of this experimental population of Mexican wolves. Does anybody not know what they're doing tomorrow? At the end of each year, the team does a population survey to find out how many wolves are living in the wild. We've got 10 animals, we're just trying to find 1331. The front seat can just turn the antenna and find the wolf just by turning it that way. They use radio telemetry to search for wolves wearing radio collars. When they find a wolf without a collar, or one that needs a new one, they may try to capture it. Chasing wolves through tall trees in a helicopter is difficult. It's probably some of the most demanding flying I do, just between the terrain, the trees, and trying to follow a running wolf through the trees without running into anything. It's very demanding. And sticking it with a tranquilizer dart is never easy. I'm looking out of the helicopter or muggers on the side trying to locate the wolves with the radio telemetry. What you're witnessing is wildlife management in action. It's unbelievably challenging. You just got to be patient and persistent. And it's infinitely rewarding. All of these wolves right now are wild born, wild raised, and they're surviving on their own. They're not needing help to survive from us. They're doing what we want them to do, but we're really seeing a dramatic incline in the population right now. When a wolf is delivered, the processing team goes to work immediately. Who's doing the microchips? This animal came in pretty hot from the chase and everything else, and through the IV fluids and cold packs, we've actually got her temperature back down to normal. The team documents the wolf's physical characteristics. It provides immunizations, monitors vital signs, and does any doctoring that's needed. So this is pretty much a resolving bite wound. The priority is to get the animal collared and back into the wild as soon and as safely as possible. For three straight years, the Mexican wolf population has increased by at least 10%. But this year's count was better than ever. The 2014 Mexican wolf population survey documented a minimum of 109 wolves in the wild, a 31% increase that finally broke the century mark. We're busting at the seams with wolves right now for this recovery area. With 19 packs and 38 pups, the future is bright for Mexican wolves. And it's only getting brighter. In 2015, big changes to the rules governing the recovery efforts gave Mexican wolves more room to roam. The area they're allowed to occupy in Arizona and New Mexico grew from 7,000 to more than 150,000 square miles. And the goal for the number of wolves more than tripled, from 100 to as many as 325. It's a number the project partners believe will give the wolves the greatest chance of success. A number that strikes a balance between the wolf population, available prey resources, and public acceptance. A number that ensures the Mexican wolf's comeback continues.\nComment: I am so happy that the mexican wolves are in the wild and more and more are coming god bless the people who saved this wolf species"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

They're owned by humans and tortured and hurt so that their owners can use them to give \"elephant rides\" to tourists and for street begging. These elephants, if I recognize it correctly, are at the Save Elephant Foundation in Thailand, a sanctuary for abused and mistreated elephants (most are blind from bull hooks, have broken legs, backs, can't walk very well - all courtesy of people). They are located next door to a trekking camp where the elephants are captive, often calling for help with their cries. Elephants are very empathetic and protective and when one of their kind calls for help, even if they're not part of their herd, they want to help out. But they can't in this case, because of what I've explained above.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over.

Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines.

Talking to the many experts the general opinion was that rats were not much use as there attention span was very short due to the harsh working environment. There were similar problems with sniffer dogs."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: That porcupine was cool; lucky where you go there are actually animals. Everything is dead where I live, and I'm lucky if I see a lizard or deer. No interesting animals like moose, porcupines, elk, beavers, crocs, or anything like that here."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Their mission is to provide a safe, natural lifetime home for captive-born wildcats in need. Please visit their website to learn more about their residents and how you can help!  the Honey Badger book now:  RANDALL'S AUTHENTIC SOUNDBOARD: \nTranscript: This is a bobcat. They're beautiful. I love bobcats, and they're found throughout North America. Look at this one just chilling in a box. Bobcat in a box. Look, this one only has three legs! And you know what? His name is Howie. And he's a resident at the Wildcat Haven Sanctuary. Watch him just sip, sip, sip some water. He and others like him are rescued from assholes that think that they can maintain an exotic animal in their house. Look at this beautiful serval. Servals are amazing, but they're from Africa and the Sahara. So what's it doing here in beautiful Sherwood, Oregon? I'll tell you, as I was saying, many assholes out there think it's okay to raise an exotic animal. And they have no prior experience, and it's just horrible. So, they wind up here, thankfully, where they're well taken care of. And the Tuller family is doing an amazing job. This sanctuary is now open to the public, and they're provided with everything they need. Look, they're all just chilling! Bobcats, FYI, eat all sorts of nasty shit, I'm telling you, from rabbits to chickens. Oh, look at this! It's the Wildcat Haven Cougar Alley! Now, cougars are awesome, beautiful, big wildcats. Oh, hello there! Meow. This gorgeous baby is like, wait a second, do I know you? Now, the Wildcat Haven Sanctuary is home to bobcats, cougars, hybrids, lynx, servals, and tigers. It is an amazing organization, a non-profit, a no-kill sanctuary. Oh my goodness, and look how precious this cougar is! Hi sweetie, how are you doing? I'm fine, just chilling. You have any antelope on ya? This one just wants some tender vittles. Sniffing around, sniffing around. Meow. More like, roar! Oh, how gorgeous. Now, they also have these hybrids that you just saw there, where it's a mix between a wildcat and a domestic. Oh my shits-o, look at this tiger! It's coming right at me! Oh, how precious. Tiger just wants some rubs. Look how affectionate this baby is. Oh my goodness. And this is Nora, the Bengal tiger. Now, Bengal tigers get this way due to a lack of red and yellow pigments. Hello! And also, inbreeding promotes recessive traits, and having the lack of the orange is a recessive trait. And sadly, a lot of inbreeding is done just to, you know, continue this species. But they're gorgeous. All of these rescued wildcats are getting a new lease on life, thanks to the Wildcat Haven Sanctuary. The Wildcat Haven Sanctuary receives no state or federal funding, and they rely on funds from sponsors and donors like us. Please, do something. www.wildcathaven.org Click me now! Go ahead, click this video! Oh, I know you want to.\nComment: i hope it's not as confined as it looks...i hope it really is a sanctuary for them"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Big Cat Rescue recently installed a solar power system thanks to the generous support of The Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, TECO-Tampa Electrical and Solar Energy Management. We're so happy that the sanctuary was given the opportunity to help save the planet by utilizing green energy sources and we hope to expand in the future!Check in on our solar power system here:  Energy Management:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Big Cat Rescue is going greeeeen! What? What does this mean? Oh. Big Cat Rescue decided to do our part to help save the planet by installing a solar power system. The installation was made possible by grants from the Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, and a solar electric rebate from TECO. The overall cost of the installation was $18,250. It took the team from Solar Energy Management around three days to install the system. They have to make sure that the solar panels are at the optimal angle so they can capture as much energy as possible from the sun. Throughout the installation, the team were constantly supervised by the cats. In particular, Joseph and Sasha. And, of course, TJ the tiger who was very interested in what was happening around him. For the projected 25-year life of the system, annual utility savings are expected to average around $1,542. So this will total to over $38,000 in savings. And just as importantly, carbon dioxide emissions that will be saved over the life of the system is projected at 157 tons, which is equivalent to driving 314,000 automotive miles. The sanctuary will be using the energy to power all of our pool pumps. So our tigers will have a place to cool off. Max the bobcat can take the occasional dip. And we can constantly replace the water that TJ splashes out of his pool. Plus, any excess power goes backwards through the electrical meter and is supplied to the main office building. Solar Energy Management generously donated two extra panels to the sanctuary. So instead of 20 panels, we have 22. And all 22 individual modules have their own microinverter underneath the panel. What's a microinverter, you might ask? And that's the box right here. And that's the box right here. So the advantages to the microinverter technology are if partial shading occurs or bird droppings fall on a panel and it degrades the performance of this panel, it doesn't affect any of the rest of the panels, so you can maximize power production. And the data collected by all 22 microinverters is transferred to the communication gateway, which then verifies that they're functioning and transmits the data, which is collected every five minutes, wirelessly to the main office where we can check on their status. You can actually monitor the output and production from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. On the webpage, you can check that all the panels are functioning correctly, see how much energy they've produced over different periods of time, and see the environmental benefits to date, such as how the energy could be used. And you can even see how many trees we've saved with our carbon offset. We're so pleased that we've been able to take our first step towards using green energy, thanks to the generous support of several organizations. Our solar panel system is also very easy to add on to, so we hope to do this in the future and continue to do our part for the environment. And I'm sure TJ will enjoy the entertainment.

So the advantages to the microinverter technology are if partial shading occurs or bird droppings fall on a panel and it degrades the performance of this panel, it doesn't affect any of the rest of the panels, so you can maximize power production. And the data collected by all 22 microinverters is transferred to the communication gateway, which then verifies that they're functioning and transmits the data, which is collected every five minutes, wirelessly to the main office where we can check on their status. You can actually monitor the output and production from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. On the webpage, you can check that all the panels are functioning correctly, see how much energy they've produced over different periods of time, and see the environmental benefits to date, such as how the energy could be used. And you can even see how many trees we've saved with our carbon offset. We're so pleased that we've been able to take our first step towards using green energy, thanks to the generous support of several organizations.

Big Cat Rescue recently installed a solar power system thanks to the generous support of The Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, TECO-Tampa Electrical and Solar Energy Management. We're so happy that the sanctuary was given the opportunity to help save the planet by utilizing green energy sources and we hope to expand in the future!Check in on our solar power system here:  Energy Management:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Big Cat Rescue is going greeeeen! What? What does this mean? Oh. Big Cat Rescue decided to do our part to help save the planet by installing a solar power system. The installation was made possible by grants from the Body Shop Foundation, C1 Bank, and a solar electric rebate from TECO. The overall cost of the installation was $18,250. It took the team from Solar Energy Management around three days to install the system. They have to make sure that the solar panels are at the optimal angle so they can capture as much energy as possible from the sun. Throughout the installation, the team were constantly supervised by the cats. In particular, Joseph and Sasha. And, of course, TJ the tiger who was very interested in what was happening around him. For the projected 25-year life of the system, annual utility savings are expected to average around $1,542. So this will total to over $38,000 in savings. And just as importantly, carbon dioxide emissions that will be saved over the life of the system is projected at 157 tons, which is equivalent to driving 314,000 automotive miles. The sanctuary will be using the energy to power all of our pool pumps. So our tigers will have a place to cool off. Max the bobcat can take the occasional dip. And we can constantly replace the water that TJ splashes out of his pool. Plus, any excess power goes backwards through the electrical meter and is supplied to the main office building. Solar Energy Management generously donated two extra panels to the sanctuary. So instead of 20 panels, we have 22. And all 22 individual modules have their own microinverter underneath the panel. What's a microinverter, you might ask? And that's the box right here. And that's the box right here. So the advantages to the microinverter technology are if partial shading occurs or bird droppings fall on a panel and it degrades the performance of this panel, it doesn't affect any of the rest of the panels, so you can maximize power production.

These are cats that were abandoned, abused, neglected, discarded etc. Cheetah's are harder for people to get as pets. That means there are not usually any being discarded.

When the southern flying squirrel takes off, his touchdowns are unrivaled. Biology professor Dr. John Scheibe has been captivated by flying squirrels for more than 20 years. What we're going to do now is see just exactly how well this animal can perform, how well this animal can glide, what kind of distance he can get across our athletic field. The squirrels launched in this stadium will fly, just as they do in the wild, at no risk to the animals. Their wings are flaps of skin stretched between their wrists and their ankles. Their hands and feet wiggle in opposite directions to help control their descent. A tail with feathered fur helps them change direction mid-flight. Cartilage alongside their wrists can slow them down for landing. This cartilage flares and acts like a stole tip on the wing of an airplane on a short runway. Kickoff hovers 50 feet in the air. Like the limbs of their trees, a branch serves as a runway. It's game time. It's a tough starting point coming out of the back line from high atop the back of the end zone. This is an absolutely perfect day to take a flying leap. Well, it's a big time challenge before him. A lot of defenders, very limited options, but you know he's got a game plan. And there he goes. Let it fly. Look at that style. A picture perfect glide hanging through the air. But wait a minute. He's hooking a right turn. Nobody expected this. He sticks the landing, goes under the fence, and up he goes. He goes under the fence and under the bleachers. We won't be seeing him back on the field any time soon. We have another nine or ten squirrels ready to go. These animals are clearly gliding, and they're actually doing better than just a regular glide. They're actually getting some pretty good distance. I would say that they've done remarkably well. They have complete control. They can turn. They can even go 180 degrees. They can take off in one direction and land in the opposite direction. They're pretty spectacular.\nComment: Guys, why the hell would you forcefully squeeze a squirrel like that just because you're describing their functions??

The sanctuary is a permanent home to over 100 rescued big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards. As well as smaller species like bobcats, servals, and sand cats. Campers arrive every day and get to explore our 55 acre property, making sure they say hello to the cats and taking lots of photos along the way. While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this. We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life. Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans. They get to do lots of fun activities, like making Big Cat popsicles and learning about our operant conditioning program and why it's so important to the cats at the sanctuary. Then campers observe Big Cat keepers handing out the popsicles they made and the cats willingly participating in our operant conditioning program.

That would be good to get some bottle into them as well. No. He's getting a little bit overzealous, a bit too pushy. Sure enough, Spot soon gets his strength back. And it's not long before he perks up and begins to take on the family dogs, Caesar and Ruby. Caesar's happy because his tail's wagging. He did his whole trying to get them to play thing. Oh, here he goes. He'll do it again now. Good boy, Caesar. Good boy. Once things are all tidied up, Giles takes time to reflect on the impact the cubs are having on conservation. We're doing exactly what I set out to achieve, in that we are raising significant funds that we're going to put towards what I feel is the most successful and appropriate tiger conservation program for Sumatran tigers. These cubs are raising more money per day than it costs to run that program every day. So every day that these guys are on display, we are saving the Sumatran tiger in Karinci Sabat National Park. With the help of Kerry and son Kynan, he's got a new plan to help raise money to save the wild Sumatran tigers. Tiger cub paw prints. Glad I don't have to deal with you when you're bigger. You're already bad enough. Are you ready, Kynan, to help? So these are going to be the little canvases that we get their little paws on. I'm thinking $50 for a paw. Every single last cent will go back into conservation. Second born Stripe is as vocal as ever. But as usual, Spot takes it all in his stride. We're going down now. Is he asleep? He is. Done. She's poor. It's better than poo. Yeah, because it's not smelly. At least the water's nice and warm today. OK, all yours. Before 40 paw prints are sold, that'll be another $2,000 towards protecting tigers in the wild.

Otters have a long muscular tail, short stout legs and thick oiled fur. Small rounded ears and nostrils close when the otter is underwater. In Florida, river otters weigh 11 to 31 lbs. and males are larger than females.River otters forage alone or in pairs. They are active during the day and at night, hunting in streams, rivers and ponds for fish, crayfish and turtles. Otters have a high metabolic rate, an adaptation for living in an aquatic environment where body heat is rapidly lost. They need to eat 15% of their body weight a day. Although otters always remain in or near the water, they spend their inactive time in burrows dug into riverbanks or at other rest sites on land. Dens are located in shelters dug by other animals or natural hollows.Otters breed once a year and in Florida mating occurs in fall and winter. Though the embryos develop for about 8 weeks. Litters usually consist of 2-4 kits, which are born fully furred. The young open their eyes after a month and are weaned at three months. They travel and feed with their mother until they are about a year old. River Otters was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro / South Florida 2014.\nTranscript: ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪\nComment: Was I the only one who thought an alligator was going to eat an otter?

The bucks are the ones with the brown on their heads - the brown is staining from tree bark as they rub their antlers on trees.  They will be snow white again when they shed their winter coats.  They are not regulars in our neck of the woods so we didn't have the opportunity to see them with their antlers.  We sure would have loved to.  We did get a brief glimpse of the old buck with his wide, palmated antlers.  It seems that as the albino bucks age their antlers get thicker & thicker.  We learned shortly after this filming that the old buck (with the limp) was taken by wolves.  They only came around a few days but we sure enjoyed seeing them.  The big buck especially, who we called Big Al, was absolutely magnificent.  So far we haven't had a glimpse of the two remaining bucks this winter.\nTranscript: ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪\nComment: Awesome video. Is it rare to have so many albino deer in your area? There must be a law against shooting them as I assume they would be a lot easier to spot than a regular deer when there isn't snow on the ground. I also see there tarsal glands are stained brown. I would guess a regular deers tarsals are stained too but I've never noticed against there brown hide. Again nice video."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

BCR staff managed to net Bellona, she was treated for injuries at Florida Veterinary Specialists and has been under the care of BCR staff ever since.Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, this week's podcast is an update on, it's an update on Bellina the bobcat. She was hit by a car a few weeks back, and if you wonder why I'm kind of talking low, well right behind me, a few acres back, that's our rehab area, and that's where Bellina and any other rehab bobcats we might get live before they're released, and she's going to go there. It's a very naturalistic enclosure. There's lots of places for her to hide. We have her, her enclosure's a little bit set up for handicapped animals, did just have all that surgery on her leg, so it enables her to get around. So even though Bellina looks a little bit freaked out right now, she's running up and down the side of the closure. That's actually a good sign for us. It means she doesn't want to be caged up. She wants to get out of captivity, and the good thing about our rehab area, it's a very quiet area. It's nice and isolated, so she's going to be able to peacefully recover from her surgery back there. She'll sort of relearn how to hunt with her repaired leg, and really, even though she's stressed out right now, or she seems stressed out, she's going to have a good, quiet recovery, and there's no way she's going to get accustomed to people. So in the rehab bobcat cage, we have a way to feed them remotely, so we can put the prey animals, which are usually live rats, we can put them in these tubes, and the tubes have several different splits, and they can end up popping up in any area of the cage, and we have this enclosure completely covered with old trees, logs, brush, a lot of places for the prey animal to hide, as well as for the bobcat to hide, so they really have to fine-tune their senses, watch out for these prey animals, and really, it gets them ready for release back into the wild. She's still being fed dead prey right now, but in a couple weeks, we'll be able to feed live prey through the tubes, so she'll be able to relearn how to hunt, relearn how to use that repaired leg. You might wonder how we are aware of the progress of our rehab bobcats, and actually, what we do is we have several remote cameras back there, so we can watch the rehab enclosure from all angles, and we never have people around the enclosure. This really gives us a great idea of how well the animal is hunting, if it's hunting, and really, how ready it is for release. It's pretty amazing, and we're keeping our fingers crossed that real soon, come spring, when there's lots of prey animals out there, she'll be healthy and healed, and we can release her back like we have the previous ones. You can help us change the way people treat big cats by texting TIGER to 20222.\nComment: @hummerwayo ahhhh, she was lucky not to have been hit, that must be one loyal animal to find you in a 5 mile radius, but if you do become inequipped to take care of it remember there are places that are able to. ;)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

The white sticks out, so its chances of being seen by an eagle or a python, a mongoose, a rival predator, are so much greater. The normal coloured cubs, they blend with the forest floor, the leaf litter, the dappled light in the forest, they kind of disappear. The white cub sticks out like a beacon, very very vulnerable, and its colour makes it even more vulnerable. See the white tiger there trying to suckle on the other tiger, instinctive, gets no milk so immediately starts shouting. All three cubs now gone to sleep. Clambering over these rocks has taken it out of them, all their heads going down, little yawns, eyes closing, nice warm rocks, sun dropping now, temperature dropping, and they're all off for a nice little snooze. The number of sounds that I use to communicate with the cubs, I give a little purring sound, this is what a cheetah mother uses with her cubs, see how it calms them down, and then I use the little chuffing sound. See the other cubs are responding to the purr. Today the little cubs, just a month old, have had their first experience of water, and their first swimming experience. Now of all the big cats, tigers love the water the most. They live in areas where there are big monsoon rains, big rivers, and they will swim. In fact, in the Shundabans, they will swim 15 kilometers between the islands hunting for food. Watch how Shine helps Shunda climb out of the water. This is a typical den site that a tigress will use, nice little caves, and in here she can put these little cubs, get them into the crevices, and make it difficult for a rival predator to get inside. Now every few days, she will move those cubs to a new den site. When the scent builds up, the urine, the dung inside the den, it becomes smelly, and she takes the cub and moves it to a den site that she's found somewhere nearby.\nComment: Thank you John for these great movies.\nI hope the white tiger will survive the next 100 years or will we be too late saving them?!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

The lionesses haven't made a successful kill in days. All three are producing milk. They need to replenish their reserves. Kali splits off from the pride, while mother and Ani hide the cubs. She heads to a narrow island that sits just above the water table. In winter, grass above the water line dries out. It's perfect camouflage for a tawny coat. And dry ground is the lechwe's achilles heel, the long hooves that make them fast in the water slow them down on terra firma. The lioness can clock nearly 40 miles per hour on hard ground, but she can only sprint for 100 yards. She has to close the gap between them before she attacks. Kali's impatient. She closes in too fast. The lechwe uses the head start to bolt for the water. Again, the swamp defeats her.\nComment: was evolution drunk and high or sometihng when it designed those legs? slowing a land animal on land to make it faster when running in water?

Today Simon, the Founder of Wildlife Aid Foundation, was called out to rescue an adult Fox that was tangled up in a shed somewhere in Epsom.To his amazement, the lady opened the door to a very embarrassed looking fox who had come a cropper on a lawn mower's power cable!Simon struggled to understand just how the poor Fox could get so entangled in such a small piece of exposed cable. He did his best to restore the Fox's dignity and freedom, however the constriction on his leg was too bad and required treatment back at the wildlife hospital.As it's St George's Day we have decided to called the Fox St George (only for online referencing), however we can't see him slaying any Dragon's anytime soon!You can follow St George's progress on our Facebook page: www.facebook.com/wildlifeaidAbout TheWildlifeAidTVEver wanted to see the goings on behind the scenes at a Wildlife Rescue Centre? Well now you can! We have super cute hedgehogs eating their dinner, dramatic rescues of wild deer and everything in between.\nTranscript: Well, we've got a fox trapped in a shed and apparently he's trapped in some wire in the shed, so I'm not quite sure what kit we're going to need. Hello, do you have a fox trapped in a shed? Yes, it's a one hind leg, very tight. Is it? Yeah, he got so frightened up there. Well, I can see the injuries. He looks very tightly constricted by one of his legs. It looks incredibly tight. I don't really, he's mangy as well, which is a slight worry. What I want to try and do is grasp him so when I finish he can't leg it at great speed. All right, foxy dogs. How he's got stuck around that is absurd. I'm trying to get the fox out without damaging the lady's lawnmower, which is going to be quite interesting. I'm afraid he's already bitten through the mains cable by himself. There's nothing I can do about that. That was not me, I'm innocent. If I can get this handle off the lawnmower, that might give me a bit of slack to play with. Okay, now, I'm getting somewhere. That's it, now the pressure's off. All right, fella. You could have done this if you tried. Okay, he doesn't know it yet, but he's out. So before he knows he's out, I just need to get him grasped so he can't escape, which I've now done. Now I can move that out of the way. I can put the lady's lawnmower back together in a minute, but it has made the leg swollen, and because he's got mange anyway, he'll have to come back into the centre, and we'll see how much damage it's done to the leg. If it's been shut for too long, then obviously there's going to be a constriction problem. You tell them what one pot's contained without me being bitten. That's a bonus. Do they know how long he was stuck? Probably not more than overnight. I'm hoping there's not going to be a serious constriction. Toes are nice and warm. Yeah. Still very swollen. So what I'm probably going to do is shave that bit, so that we can really keep an eye on it. I'm not going to clip it right to the skin, just so that we can see what we're looking at, because sometimes these injuries take a few days to really show themselves. Having clipped it, you can really see how red it is. If this tissue dies here, then there's nothing you can do to stop it. So what we don't want to see is that going sort of black and hard tomorrow. I'm just going to put some of this lovely gel on it today. Just to keep it moist while the skin is hopefully healing. You can see the mange all around this area. It's really common to see it on the rumps of foxes. They quite often get sore patches over the bony hips as well. His heart's really slow. Wheezy as well. Well, he's having antibiotics anyway, for any secondary skin infections that they have from the mange, which is also going to help with his chesty breathing there. And then this is the treatment for the mange. They have to have this every week for three weeks. And then the final treatment will be a spot-on treatment before he goes free. Hopefully, if that leg's OK, we might only have to keep him a couple of weeks. Well, we've done all we can for now. He'll be with us two weeks. He'll be very lucky, probably three weeks, but he should go out in a lot better state than he is now. It's just a matter for the next 72 hours of keeping an eye on that wound, because that is absolutely critical. It's a tinny little house. How do you like it? The one in the corner's just non-stop stuffed his face since he got here. Like, oh, yeah, Liz's face is wicked. Ow! Ow!\nComment: Can you start sharing if these animals actually recover and are able to go free again? Or if they have to stay in care or unfortunately don't make it. I'm left wondering what has happened to this little guy. Thank you for showing the vets work as well.  You are such an amazing man to take care and save these animals from such scarry situations.

Considering that the impala was 4 ft tall,  that branch where the leopard jumps from has got to be atleast 30 feet tall.  A jump from that height could severely bruise, fracture or kill us.  The way it dives its head upside down but yet lands on its feet is amazing use of the tail for balance and dynamics. Damn i can't believe this beautiful agile animal will be extinct from earth in the next 30 years."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: Just one of those freak things that happen!  Thanks and we subbed back!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

In this highlight, Forsberg describes his mission to catch a bobcat with a camera trap in Nebraska.-----A nature photographer and Nebraska native, Michael Forsberg shares his work documenting this vast landscape, its lakes, prairies along with its plants and animals.The Great Plains are a dynamic but often forgotten landscape -- overlooked, undervalued, misunderstood, and in desperate need of conservation. Forsberg's book helps lead the way forward, informing and inspiring readers to recognize the wild spirit and splendor of this irreplaceable part of the planet. - California Academy of SciencesMichael Forsberg is a Nebraska native and has focused much of his work in North America's Great Plains, once one of the greatest grassland ecosystems on Earth. His goal has been to try to capture the wild spirit that still survives in these wide-open spaces and put a face to the often overlooked native creatures and landscapes found there. His hope is that the images can build appreciation and go to work to inspire conservation efforts on the land far into the future.Forsberg received a degree in geography with an emphasis in environmental studies from the University of Nebraska, and worked briefly as a seasonal ranger in the National Park Service before accepting a job as a staff photographer and writer producing natural history stories for NEBRASKAland Magazine, the state's conservation publication. He worked at the magazine for six years before starting his own photography business and gallery.Forsberg's work has appeared in publications including Audubon, National Geographic, National Wildlife, and Natural History, and recognized in the Pictures of the Year and Wildlife Photographer of the Year competitions. In 2001, his image of a Nebraska tallgrass prairie was selected for an International Postage Stamp. In 2004, he was awarded a Conservation Education Award from The Wildlife Society. Recently, he was featured in the PBS documentary \"Crane Song,\" and was the 2009 recipient of the North American Nature Photographer's Association Mission Award.\nTranscript: For a TV, the world is thinking. For these four years, I tried to photograph predators like wolves, grizzly bears, mountain lions, bison, all these creatures that still just barely exist in certain areas of their range. And we were successful on all those except for a bobcat. So when the field work was all done, I went back home and we had about three or four months to get the book out the door. And somebody called me from a little prairie outside of my hometown in Lincoln, Nebraska and said, we think we've seen a bobcat. You can try to photograph your bobcat here. So what the heck? So I went out and I put this camera trap up along this game trail. Here's the camera in a waterproof housing. Right here is a transmitter and a receiver where an infrared beam is going across this game trail. And here's a little flash. And here's a little flash right here. So if something walks down here and steps over that log, in theory the camera should take a picture, right? For the first two months, this is what I got. Nothing. I don't know if it was the prairie fairies or if it was my friends playing tricks on me or what, but we didn't get any pictures of anything other than just nothing. And then, finally, after the turn of the year, we started to get photographs. Raccoon first. Bunny rabbit. Farmer Jones cat down the road. Farmer Jones dog down the road. Good job, California. I got a call in early March 2009 from my publisher, and they said, Mike, you got to pull the plug. Book's got to go off to print. You're done. I went out to pick up the camera traps. I had two pictures in the last deal. Here's the first one. And then an hour later, and it was really great to end with that photograph because that's the last picture that was made for this book. And it sort of creates the arc in the story for me because the look in that bobcat's eye is that same look that I saw in that burrowing owl's eye maybe 10 years earlier. The other thing was was that after traveling and being gone away from my family for all that time, I took this photograph 15 minutes from my home in a prairie that's been restored.\nComment: Wow, he managed to take a photograph of those dangerous predatory bison!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Hare sheep is what they are, get away from rabbits for a little bit. Anyway, these are the hare sheep, here comes Shelby, she's an Anatolian Marema Lifestyle Guardian dog and she's just a little bit over a year old. She keeps the sheep safe in here, come here Shelby, come here girl, good girl. We used to lose sheep to the coyotes out here and ever since we got her, come here Shelby, come girl, she's really kept an eye out on them. It's real fun to watch her because right about 4 in the afternoon when it starts getting dark, she'll go ahead and walk the fence line. She's definitely keeping the coyotes out, they had multiple holes along the fence line. It's about 5 acres in here and it's mostly all blackberry. All this right here that's all cleared out used to look like what's over there on the other side of the fence, sheep can't get to that so that's all overgrown. That's what it looked like and this is what it looks like over here now and they still have a lot to go. Right now, they're eating some hay, some orchard grass and these hare sheep, there's a few different breeds in here and I'll go through them here. This one here that's looking back at us, she's a Catan-Dorper cross and there's a few of those. Most of all the white ones are Catan-Dorper and that guy right there in the middle, he's a breeding ram, that white one and that's one of the breeding rams and the one right next to him that's got the little horns there, he just moved, he's another breeding ram. We keep two in here and that one that just poked her head out, she's a Dorper-Barbados black belly cross and this orange one here, she's a Catan. She's an orange Catan and the breeding ram, he's a white Catan and this little one that looks like deer with the black belly, they are the purebred American Barbados black belly and that one there with the black head, she's a Blackhead-Dorper. There's two of those and they're registered and papered and everything and this little guy here in the front, little red guy there, he is a Barbados cross. We don't know what his sire was, the previous ram that we had in here, he was sired by that one and we don't know what he was anyway. He's a pretty looking, he's a weather and these two rams here, they're unrelated to all of these ewes and most of all these ewes were born in December of last year or so they're about 11 months old so they're all coming into heat now and we'll probably have some spring lambs in March so I'll probably do a video of them so look forward to that. There's two black ones in the back or the dark colored ones back there, there's two of them, they're sisters. I don't know if I can get a good shot from this side of the fence but they're Columbian Shetland cross, there she is, poked her head right in the middle of those and hair sheep you don't need to shear them, doctor tails or trim their hooves, they're very low maintenance, they're good for brush eating, for pets and for meat as well. They're gaining a lot of popularity out here in the northwest, they're very popular out in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, parts of California, Mexico and Central America and South America and down south of Mexico they call them the Pelebues, so they're nice animals to keep, they're very lean, mild taste and they are nowhere near as stinky as goats and they have very good mothering instincts, so they're easy keepers these guys, that's why we like them. Some of these have their tails docked just for the look really, usually you want to dock the tails on wool sheep because of the maggots get stuck back there, causes the animal to get sick and then die, but because these animals have hair, it's not like a horse or a cow or a dog, it's not going to get stuck back there in the wool, but we do it just for the look, I think they look nice with their tails docked, they've really done a good job of clearing this up out here. There's another breed of hair sheep, they're called St. Croix, they're from the island of St. Thomas and they're even more parasite resistant, they don't get to be as meaty, they're still pretty nice animals. And then there's a few other hair sheep, I forget what the names of the breeds are. That's the video, hope you guys enjoyed it, if you have any questions or comments, post them up, and if you haven't subscribed, subscribe, you're welcome to, and we'll catch you next time.\nComment: Awesome man!

Of course, we provide all of our cats with lots of natural shade, cooled ends to escape the heat, and for those who like the water, they have pools or access to parts of our lake. But to make sure all of our residents are as comfortable as possible, we make them Big Cat Popsicles as part of the enrichment program. And you guessed it, the popsicle flavors don't sound that appealing to you and me. Here's what we make. Bloodsicles, Sardini Martinez, Poultry Pops, Serpenturf, and Shrimpsicles. And we make them in all different sizes for all of the different species here at Big Cat Rescue. Here's some we made earlier. Now let's go refresh some Big Cat. Bongo, with a drop of Guiro. Bake and beat with a piano. And rhyme and braise like a bang, bang, bang, and boom. Take a skill out of conga, with a dash of cha-cha.

It's Great value, well camouflaged, well made, easy to put up and take down, not like the fold away dome hides at all. It's all waterproof and I was using it today in the pouring rain and didn't get wet at all ( though you will if u have the zip part of the windows down as rain gets through the mesh). All in all a very happy purchase, just hope I get some good use from it.\nTranscript: Hello, this is my review of the One Man Photography Chairhide. As you can see it's nice and camouflaged. The one-way lining is velcro strapped. So you can tear that down and have a nice little opening to point your camera out. The front zips down, so you have a nice wide opening if you want a better view. Have a look in the air for any birds of prey. But today I've been using it zipped up like this and it's worked really well. The birds can't see me at all. I've got some nice photographs of some starlings on there and a robin as well. The chairhide's got plenty of room inside. It can be pegged down, comes with a nice carry bag. The backpack fits on your back. It weighs about 5kg, which is quite heavy. But with the backpack sticking on your back it shouldn't be too bad. There's a few windows here. One there, one there. Same on the other side. We've got one-way viewing mesh, so you can see out but they can't see in. And you can velcro them down as well, so you can have the thing completely open if you like. There's also these little covers. They just zip down like that, let you see out. Well, it's one-way but from a distance. If you want to get in, just lift the front up. It's a bit of a faff one-handed, but... Alright, maybe quite a faff one-handed. There you go, you can go the same side. It is a lot easier when you've got two hands to use. It's a nice comfy chair, about the same as you get in a camp stove. Cup holder. Nice inside, easy to put up, easy to take down. Only take you a couple of minutes to put it away. Loads of room inside, you can fit your tripod in. And a camera bag as well. Really nice chair hide, this one's the Stealth Gear one. From Morris Photography for about £75. Really great value. Apart from the weight, which makes it a bit awkward to take with you everywhere you go. But if you set somewhere up, feed a station, it should work a treat. You get some great photos, birds don't even know you're there.\nComment: @OrpheusonRS I think until to try wearing a lumpy backpack that weighs 5KG's and contains this chair hide you'll realise it does feel quite heavy. Thing is the camera gear also weighs a few more KG's and it all adds up. Due to my transport limitations and location limitations I've not bothered using the chair hide and since aquired a a stealthwildlife bag hide. It weighs much less as it's just mesh material all be it quite heavy duty and is much easier to carry around over the shoulder. "},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

This is Wendy the Guide Girl, also known as Hawk Hunter Diva if you're watching YouTube. I'm sitting in my own back pasture instead of down at the leaves, shopping for some venison. I haven't seen anything I wanted to fling an arrow at yet. I'm in the antler hunting mode. So I got some new stuff from Buzzy. It's called Bowhunter Setup Scrape Juice. So I'm going to test that out today and see if I can't bring in something new. I see something just jumped the fence and I haven't seen it before. So let's check it out and see if he's a shooter. Well, good evening. Welcome to Butch and Wendy's Hunting Adventures. Hawk Hunter Diva decided to go try to get some venison. So we're here in the Hill Country, Texas. The deer are a little smaller up here compared to South Texas or up north, but we have a whole lot of them. I've been sitting in a pop-up blind watching a stream of does and little bucks and stuff. And I was actually after this eight point buck. He was nice and mature, but he didn't come in this morning. And while I was sitting there, this little ten point came in. Well, for the Hill Country, he's a nice little deer. And I decided to go ahead and take him. I had a good hunt. It was nice. And another deal was, the wind wasn't quite blowing right. It's kind of switching around because we have a front coming in. Right now it's 76 degrees here in Central Texas, but tomorrow it's going to be 35 degrees. So actually I was even hunting in shorts this evening. But anyway, the wind was swirling. The deer kept coming in. They were a little spooky. So I'll tell you what I did. I got this Muzzy's Bowhunter set up, the scrape juice, and I sprayed a little bit out the window. And he came in shortly afterwards, but I'll tell you what, don't spray it inside the blind. It smells pretty rough, but I bet deer really like it because I had never seen this buck before out of all the deer I've been watching for the past couple of weeks. And it brought him in, so I guess it works. But have a good evening. Muzzy Phantom did the job, shot him with a crossbow. Central Hill Country of Texas, and it's October 27th, 2010. Y'all have a good evening. We're going to try to go get some more venison here this season, but I guess I'm going to have to change clothes and get something warm. See y'all next time. Later.\nComment: @yournamehere832 Oh yes it did and still is! The deer were so scraggly, I couldn't see butchering any of the does coming in but they are doing better now that everyone is feeding corn around here.

If you have a brother or sister you probably know that sibling rivalry feeling, but would you go as far as a Hyena? This week I talk about Hyena pups and how growing up with a sister is hard work!Subscribe here:  and help #SaveLions Website:     Kevin Richardson Wildlife Sanctuary's mission is to provide a self-sustaining African carnivore sanctuary for the purposes of wild species preservation through education, awareness and funding, especially pertaining to the rapid decline of large carnivores in Africa due to habitat loss, human-predator conflict, unscrupulous hunting, disease and their illegal trade.To raise awareness, Kevin has now set up his YouTube Channel 'LionWhispererTV'. The channel is all about raising awareness about not only the declining numbers of lions, but also how this rapid decrease is happening. By watching these videos, you are directly contributing to our scheme of land acquisition.Kevin captures the majority of his footage on GoPro cameras, allowing the viewer to get as close as possible to the lions. By doing this, Kevin hopes to give people an insight into the lives of these beautiful creatures and to let them see just what they can do to help. You can nearly touch them.\nTranscript: So many people have been asking questions about these spotted hyena, so I'm continuing on the interesting facts about these incredible animals. Firstly, they're normally born about two in the litter, normally twins, and they're born a chocolatey brown colour, kind of the colour of Woody's paws here. What's really interesting about them is that if they are born the same sex, then they fight like cat and dog, and normally what will happen is one will suppress the other from getting access to mother's milk. Normally the mothers are really pretty good, and although they try and intervene and make their cubs behave nicely and try and suckle both, the one will be more dominant and will always try and suppress the other, inevitably ending in the one dying. Interestingly what happens is that if they are born opposite sex, then immediately the male submits to the female, and once he submits, she allows him the access to milk. So you'll probably find when you see them out in the wild, you'll see one relatively big baby and one small one, so he doesn't get the premium milk or access to milk all the time, but she will allow him to do that and won't fight with him all the time. The reason why they can inflict such damage at such a young age is that the baby-spotted hyena is born fully mobile, in other words they can scurry around, and they're born with a full set of deciduous teeth, as well as being able to have a very basic vision, I mean they can make out shapes and different forms, obviously the visual acuity gets better as they get older. It's really interesting because compared to a lion, which is born completely blind, it's born helpless and has no teeth, you can see how advanced the hyenas are when they come out into the world. You start to see a side of hyenas that they actually are built really as a predator and they're built to succeed and are really fascinating animals and I hope that you'll join me for more interesting facts about the spotted hyena on future videos that will be posted on the Lion Whisperer TV channel. If you enjoyed that, please tune in again, if you're not subscribed, please subscribe and also share the videos, especially if you like them.\nComment: Woody! It's always a great vlog with Woody!

Comprehensive plans for bears were formulated in 1990 (grizzlies) and 1993 (black bears).\n\nGenerally, the plan concluded that Alberta's population was healthy and in no danger of overexploitation. The objectives emphasized that the current population should be maintained, that hunting harvests for Albertans and non-residents could be locally increased, that more nuisance bears be translocated, and that research be continued.\n Where populations are adequate, high-quality recreational hunting could be encouraged particularly in areas where it might contribute to a reduction in the incidence of problems. Additionally, the significance of black bear predation of moose and other northern ungulates needs to be determined."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}
