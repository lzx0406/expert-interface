Below is the conversation.................................................................................................................................

Dear Mr. Harkness,

Thank you for contacting the Sierra Club. We took a look at your video and consulted with scientists at Everglades National Park. Your video actually demonstrates the need to restore flow across the central Everglades and elevate Tamiami Trail.

As you have documented, there is some localized northward flow just to the east of S333, because the water level on the west of the L67 extension levee is higher than water level on the east. Water levels are substantially lower in Northeast Shark Slough than western shark slough because of water management. This all part of the reason why we need to restore more natural flow by elevating the road. The net water flow through the culverts documented by the US Geological Survey since 1939 is north to south, and water will flow north to south as we redirect more water into Northeast Shark Slough under the 2.6 mile bridge.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Ullman
Senior Everglades Representative
Sierra Club

The reply to the conversation.................................................................................................................................


Hi Jonathan

I would like to thank you for writing me and taking the time to look into this.

Keep in mind the entire time since the 1 mile bridge has been built water has not flowed South underneath it.

Have Water Management and the National Park explain why they have not flowed water South? This is the first question we should have an answer too. We know it has not flowed South because we have checked it everyday since it's completion.

In the future when water is available we know the water will flow South. We agree with everybody about this point. But any time it is not flowed South the water will flow North due to not having enough water, being polluted, or during droughts. The bridges are going to allow the South Side to dry up in less than 24 hours during droughts and will cause a shock factor to local wildlife. Even during times when water is flowed South water levels will be so high that wildlife will not have land, and the excessive amounts of water will rot the vegetation destroying our ecosystem.
This leads to the second question that needs to be asked and answered. How does Water Management and National Park stop the Northern water flow underneath all this bridging when lock 334 opens and water is flowed South East of the lock, and when lock 333 is closed? This will create a vacuum suction drying out the South Side. A better solution they should look into is putting locks in the place of the 2.6 mile bridge area. This will prevent Northern water flow, and have more control over the water while achieving the Southern water flow in times of need. This scenario might not be as pretty as the view from the top of the concrete bridge, but it sure will save the South side of the Everglades from flooding, and loss of wildlife.This is not something you just slap together because you get some taxpayer money. 

Sierra Club if you truly care about the Everglades you will get answers for these specific questions and scenarios.",2.0,2.0,,,0,5337.0,22.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
169,16fxd6arpxo,Kev Kilo Thank you for your reply Sir. Are you aware that when there is a drought or when the locks at #334 are opened the water flows from South to North underneath the culverts where the center of the proposed 2.6 Mile Bridge is planned to be built? ,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0,5331.0,22.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

171,16fxd6arpxo,Update: Inside official source confirms that the new Everglades one mile bridge is not achieving the results that were expected. Also water is still flowing from South to North in the area of the proposed 2.6 mile bridge.,1.0,1.0,,,0,5330.0,22.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
172,16fxd6arpxo,"Update: The 333 Lock was opened allowing the L29 Canal to rise up to 6.8' allowing water to flow South. The water level on the West side of the 333 Lock was at 9.8'. The 334 Lock on the East end of the L29 Canal was closed.

However, we tested the water flow underneath the New 1 Mile Bridge and it was still not flowing South as it was intended to do even though the water table was raised.

It is great news that the water is flowing South today. The culverts radius is small and the water gets pushed through with pressure for it to travel South. This is a fact that Water Management knows about it. Another good thing about the culverts is you can block the water from flowing back North in case there is not enough water to send South, High Pollution, or in times of Droughts. If you put in place a 2.6 Mile Bridge you will have no way to control the water from coming back North. You also have to keep in mind when they open the 334 Lock to send water to the farms it's going to suck the water out from the South through the 2.6 Mile Bridge drying out the South side over night and there will be no way to stop it! 

Here are some questions taxpayers should be asking the Everglades National Park:

1) Where will you get enough water to flow South all the time?
2) How will you clean the water pollution fast enough?
3) How will you stop the water from flowing back North when you do not have enough water or when it's polluted?
4) Are you going to sacrifice the delicate Eco-System on the South side by drying it up overnight each time the farmer's need water?

Instead of a bridge they should consider a lock to control the water or clear out the existing culverts and to put more focus on cleaning the water. ",1.0,2.0,,,0,5328.0,22.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The ones I have that have been able to escape a falcon,  not all the times, is a cross breed. I have crossed a Turkish Kelebek with a Birmingham roller and a Portuguese tumbler. I call it Portuguese rollerbecks. They summersault, dive, zig-zag but still once in a while they are a meal for the peregrine falcon.

The lion grabs its victim by its mouth, closing it completely, and thus depriving the oxygen from it. Also, it stands in front of the prey to avoid being kicked. In this manner, lions can take down much more bigger animals from them. Perfect predators!",,,3.0,0.0,0,20749.0,78.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The guide was brilliant. 
Yes you can smell when they are in Musth, but only if your down wind of them.
Watch the video again, when they came across the Elephant, he was in the shade with his back to them, you couldn't see the fluid on his cheeks, you couldn't see leakage from below because his legs hid it and your up wind of him.
It isn't until we get a side on of his face do we see he is in Musth, Stretch notices, a few moments later he explains. 
This was an extraordinary example of bushmanship.
He remained calm, put his life in the firing line to protect his party. He did exactly what was necessary.

1380,PCcVs0G6-Uo,Awesome video. Is it rare to have so many albino deer in your area? There must be a law against shooting them as I assume they would be a lot easier to spot than a regular deer when there isn't snow on the ground. I also see there tarsal glands are stained brown. I would guess a regular deers tarsals are stained too but I've never noticed against there brown hide. Again nice video.,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0,15777.0,217.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I had a couple too many for the areas they worked, so I did provide some hay and some feed for mine on a regular basis, too. 

They cleaned their areas up to about five feet high of low branches. I had barbados. I loved them. Beautiful quiet lawn mowers and tree trimmers. They kept it very nice around the pond and kept all the fence rows clean.

1586,STWlFU2AOpQ,@OrpheusonRS I think until to try wearing a lumpy backpack that weighs 5KG's and contains this chair hide you'll realise it does feel quite heavy. Thing is the camera gear also weighs a few more KG's and it all adds up. Due to my transport limitations and location limitations I've not bothered using the chair hide and since aquired a a stealthwildlife bag hide. It weighs much less as it's just mesh material all be it quite heavy duty and is much easier to carry around over the shoulder. ,0.0,1.0,,,0,,,,,,,

Comprehensive plans for bears were formulated in 1990 (grizzlies) and 1993 (black bears).

Generally, the plan concluded that Alberta's population was healthy and in no danger of overexploitation. The objectives emphasized that the current population should be maintained, that hunting harvests for Albertans and non-residents could be locally increased, that more nuisance bears be translocated, and that research be continued.
 Where populations are adequate, high-quality recreational hunting could be encouraged particularly in areas where it might contribute to a reduction in the incidence of problems.

Since you want to hunt crows the .17 HMR will allow you to knock them off at longer ranges as they can be difficult to approach.  Squirrels are easier to get close to, especially in dense foliage but if you only wound it they have a tendency to hide in places you can't get them out of and thus lose the meat.  The HMR solves this because when I head shot my squirrels it removes almost the entire head.  Be safe and good hunting.",,,,,0,17542.0,274.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

1852,VF6MiJMedbc,"long..but please..let me share. i truly feel ..well i hope. 
this makes me cry. shirley and jenny..
they also bonded with others..shirley still does..i love shirley so much..
and i love jennu so much.
thier love for each other is ….so ..beautiful. i saw when they met after all those years..since the terrible..circus  :( 
but..happiness …so profound. i know shirley loves many..but her and jenny.. not just mother and child..but friendship so profound..and such deep deep love for each other. i just am sad for all her past..but the breeding place..-or whatever..that made her life so so short. but!
happiness does wonders. and i know shirley tarra..others had to make sure she didn't overdo her fun playing!! 
that…THAT makes me know…she let go of the past..and found her life again. i want to learn about  each and all the elephants here. still will jenny and shirley. …i can't imagine the loss. but..the support is beautiful. then i want to follow shirley to meet others..and tarra..and bella the dog…is another i really want to watch. 
such graceful..gentle..so intelligent..and thoughtful. bonds that will hold them forever. i hope ..i can't stand all the killing for tusks. but…also-the circus..and all other--rtiding ..why??? torture is so unbearable. i almost want that end first..-circuses and all the mean treatment. tho..losing them..to poachers…is scary. tusks?? carvings? big deal! i am an artist. there are SO many wonderful things to carve…non-living things. 
even wood..but AFTER the tree is gone. ot ..whatever. -but..marble..-so much stuff. 
what is it about ivory. yes..that you can't have it..is the want. -but the can't have..is not a challenge thing..-it is about killing! wake up people. please. elephants are so so incredible. i love all species..-all amazing lives..-so much to learn..we ..can learn much more with respect and seeing all a like us. we are a species too. who is to say what ""intelligence""is. they don't destroy the world. or hate etc. humans are …beautiful-no doubt there…a wonderful species. -but..intelligence isn'teven just the brain.. the mind! senses…feelings…nerves…hormones..all play a role..and so so so so many infinite things. that cross over..-endless network of ..BEING, LIFE. LIVING. 
but happiness is known by all in some way or another. 
jenny..life is not always in numbers. but..it is true..you had it hard. it makes me pray for nosey..hoping she will have some life..too. but..jenny..you found your life…that is what it is all about. and..i love this place. thank you all for being there sorry long. this is my special thing for jenny..and to shirley. but also tarra and others i don't know yet..who were close to jenny. and then../to follow shirley! 
it is sucha GREAT happiness for me--even tho i read someones words below about shirley keeps losing friends..but continues to have support..and make other close close friends. i am so looking forward to all stories. i wish i could buy a set..or something. -and add to it as more come out. no money-but i'd save up-if it goes to the sanctuary! 
but shirley seems..from only 3 videos..but-or 2? --but reading also. -
thing is..i sense shirley is almost like the matriarch. but also..one who needs too. who is a child also..who needs that childhood. i hope to find that here. i feel great love for her. and i know i will love all. jenny is so deep in my heart. 
and i know..feel it..jenny is forever shirley great love. not just as child..but as -bonded love. friendship love..that is profound. yes..being part of each other. mother child..but..where shirley also.. even tho..she knew..and always protected jenny. she also was there to see her play. yet ..a true mother. but..i remember when shirley was lying in the water..just…happy..but still struggling with getting up.. and jenny was playing and so so happy..but when shirley spoke..i wonder what..-its likefeelings..and more. communication..but-so amazing. but…jenny knew sshirly was still so so crazy-happy to be with her and jenny with shirley the same--it was stll so fresh..and always--ijust know..and-jenny(i think it was jenny in the water..saw it 3 or 4 ..or 5 times!…but-i think jenny in water..heard shirley..wanting to be with her-sounding to her speaking..feeling out-and trying to get up..and dong it..i am sure she got stronger with time..but-always..:( crippled like many from the terrible .. but.. -jenny went right to her..even before shirley got up..
she was right there. like she was the mom..-the one right away ..hearing shirley ask for her-or simlar-and so slowly got up..and jenny right there.. and then, oh how they use there trunks to communicate so so much. it is so much to want to watch and learn.. but. feel! it is easy to see why thier love was forever …immortalized in a way. but shirley is still here..and -oh..please be here …for as long as you live. i feel happiness in shirley differently. i feel..getting to be there for jenny was HUGE! but..i somehow sense..it is a deep gift in her. to feel a special deep empathy ..for others. 
and jenny..10 years..i knownot long long for an elephant..but a lot of time-if happy…and more. longerif tortured..but time is not alive then-in how i think. it is alive when happy..and when finding happiness. both..and more. but never bad stuff. i again..look forward to these stories. i also want to read about the place. special place. and whomever -1 or more does the filming..wonderfully done. they can be free here. -and i love this place. 
i feel such deep love for elephants and lions. -since a little little kid. ""born free""..--well-loved lions even before--but..that film. was-my ..? but..i also knew of elephants..and ever since..the two..in different ways..but love so profound and one never stronger than the other. -and cats. -abd dogs. but cats. i lived with 3 loves. i know if one day a dog is with me and a cat or whatever..-i will love the same. but.. this is about jenny.  Jenny..you had such great love all around you ..that it let you be a child again..-i think. -just from what little i read..but ..i know..i felt -feel still.. your happiness.you made beautiful friends..and -youmet shirley. and you two together found your sense of being as well..i just feel that. you got to be free! jenny..i am so happy for you for that. many don't make it. or make it long enough to find it long enough..for it to bloom and grow.. and become the love that brought out your special gift..as well as shirleys. and others..i kow..but i tsee tarra has bella..and another elephant..-becomes her friend -i just saw .. 
was looking for jenny and shirley..but-i follow what someone else asked and got info. i need to follow them first. then shirley..as well as tarra..and more. -just go with it. i am thrilled that shirley is happy..i saw she sort of recently had a 65th! i believe shirley loves life..and-wants so much to live..as they all do..-sorry so long. no more like this. please know. i needed to …write this. thank you all.  jenny..you are blessed..and i am grateful and so happy..you got your life..and shirley-so wise and intelligent ..knows that. and loves you always. you gave each other anextra bonus in life..happiness..and true love. love isn't always just..-as humans see it. it is much more. and humans knowit in them too..but..are not as open. but..some are. but again..for jenny..and shirley..because it is hard to separate you two..tho your girts for life and love are so different and so equally profound. you certainly have your own . as does shirley. ijust..thought..an RIP..is not it. it is ..yes. celebrating jenny. and jenny-i still have much to learn. the hard..i know..i wont want to…but i will. it is you. and all others too. i want to know all here. jenny. i am so happy you found your life..and how beautiful..amazing and profound it all..-was..and is. you loved life as a child. picked up from where left off..but you also were a tremendously gifted adult who truly ..i just sense..-i ? but what so far..-you spark happiness and childhood and life in others! but you also have thatbeautiful deep gift to bond. and -that you and shirley both have that..and found each other again..and likely helped each other ..-but. back to finding your lives. ..you found yours..as did shirley. you lived it with such passion..felt by so many. i just know. and shirley too.
tho you both are such individuals finding your greatest most profound inner and outer being in yourselves. individuals yes. but the other gift just as profound…was you and shirley. shirley and you. it made 10+ years a full lifetime …bless you jenny. you are one beautiful elephant. one beautiful girl. and ..i can't wait til tomorrow eve to watch more!  i wish i could visit the sanctuary. or help there. talk about a dream :) anyway. with love,  jenny your celebration showed someone i can't wait to see more -you..and you and shirley..and others!!! others too! bonds are meant to be shared with all..to include ..to live and love. a special video. i have to find out if there is a way to buy these stories..as they are. money for the sanctuary! i know many would buy them. (hint hint )  ;)  goodnight sweet girl. …i love you. i do. i love you , Jenny. <3 <3",2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,24871.0,279.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

For example in South Africa where *legal, regulated* hunting has actually saved some of the species being targeted like lions and white rhinos (which, I’ll admit I hate with a passion, too, and I’ve often gotten into heated arguments with trophy hunting proponents on the Internet despite the fact that it helps support poor local people there, as well. None of us are perfect), however, penguins living in the southernmost parts of the country, as well as in Namibia, are still very much endangered and in decline, and guess what? Sport hunters don’t want them in their collections, even though, once again, *legal and well-regulated* hunting has saved the “Big Five” in South Africa, thus it’s sort of a slap-in-the-face to us at least interested in working in properly-accredited zoos and aquariums where we work with captive-bred birds in order to at least have a viable breeding population. 

Turtles and tortoises also aren’t usually targeted by the industry, either, and yet, statistically-speaking, *they’re the most endangered group of vertebrates on this planet, right next to primates* (which I’ll also get to in a minute), so many, many properly-accredited zoos and aquariums, along with the Turtle Survival Alliance and other conservancies, collaborate to breed more endangered turtle and tortoise species so that they can, eventually, be re-released into the wild, and the great apes, for example gorillas and orangutans, that sport hunters also don’t target simply because they share over 90% of our DNA with us, are also considered critically-endangered in the wild due to habitat loss and the unsustainable bushmeat trade. The Indianapolis Zoo’s International Orangutan Center, for example, helps fund research in the Leuser Ecosystem National Strategic Area in Sumatra:

Tiger: Adult Males weigh on Average weigh 198-675lbs and are 98-154inches in length, the tail is about 24-43inches of this. Total length of just over 11.5ft and weight of 675lb, the largest ever on record weighed 858lbs

*Fun Fact*: ""The polar bear is the largest living species of terrestrial predator""

Polar Bear: Adult Males on Average weigh 770-1,540lbs and are 7'10""-9'10"" in length. The largest Polar Bear on record stood 11'1"" and weighed 2,209lbs.

*Fun Fact*: ""Polar Bears have outer and inner layers of Dense fur, and they have insulated blubber up to 4inches"", so thats 4inches before u hit anything that could harm this bear.

At up to 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) and a typical adult mass range of 600 to 1,500 kg (1,300 to 3,300 lb), a walrus can be twice the weight of a polar bear, but the bear can kill and drag this large prey with its neck or paws, meaning it is VASTLY superior in strength to Tigers.

Polar Bear bite is 1200lbs per square inch on average, Siberian have 950 and Bengal 1050.

Polar bear can kill nearly any animal with 1 swipe.

It is an established fact that a SINGLE paw swipe from a grizzly can decapitate an adult moose, and Polar bears are much larger/stronger than Grizzlys. ""Since 1895, there have been 15 reported cases of Moose decapitation by Grizzly""

I am a regular viewer of your videos. I have watched all your uploads and I have subscribed your channel long back. As, I am a Keralite, love for elephants were always in my blood. Even though, my desire is to have an elephant of my own, not for making money but as a pet to love and live with is my dream, which is actually against the low of nature. 
Watching them in their natural habitat and their own life,with their families without any constrains gives me immense pleasure.  
And the effort which you are taking for shooting these are really appreciable. 
kudos to you. 
Also, I have a request, I know its your videos and its your effort, then too, please avoid those animations and pop-ups of your pics in between the videos. 
It is highly unprofessional and spoils the view. Like how you have done in this video. 
You can show it at the beginning or at any sides rather than showing at the center.

2116,kRCw17jp0TA,"Just watched a squirrel do this. The mother was tiny....very young mother, and the babies were about 35-40% her size!!! I watched her come across the street and at first thought, that has to be a baby, but she moved from the yard next to the yard across a double wide street, went through my yard, over a fence and up another tree. I saw her close and thought it was a large tumor of something!!! It was twice the size of her little head hanging down in front and though it might be something growing on her neck. Took 2 or 3 short rests...just a couple seconds. Wasn't sure. Then I saw a squirrel come from where she had been and head across the street again, and I thought, if I see another I know it is her carrying babies. Sure enough, she did it again. About 60-75 yards, Down a tree, up over a fence, across 1 yard, across a VERY wide street, and then through my yard, over a fence, and up a tree. With the ups and downs, over 100 yards easy. She went back a 3rd time, and I walked toward the corner, in case a car came, to let them know what was going on so they didn't hit her. A lot of people don't want squirrels around for some good reasons I guess, getting into the house, chewing wires etc, but I hope none want to see a mother with babies killed. Only one car came, but this time, she stopped right in the middle of the street....exhausted...rested for 20 seconds and continued on, stopping every 10-15 yards to rest for 10-20 seconds now. She repeated this with a 4th!!! VERY tired. I put some peanuts and craisins (dried cranberries) out for her, and a bowl of water so she wouldn't have to go too far for food. She was a baby herself. Wondered what caused her to move. A cat? Hawks? Birds to close? Nest blown down from the tree? Nest infested with fleas is another reason I found online. The 3rd one was funny. They all looked like a bundle of laundry in a gray sack, but that one also had his tail wrapped around her head!!! lol.....If people worked as hard as squirrels do, even at minimum wage, we would all be millionaires in no time!!!",2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0,22001.0,434.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

2153,lOVetAeBlrw,All bullets kill. Caliber does not matter. Shot placement matters. I can miss with a .25-06 just as readily as with a .22-250 regardless of bullet energy. Some animals will drop slower than others even with an accurate shot regardless of caliber. They are dead but they just don't know it yet. That Antelope was dead standing. Great accurate heart shot. The second shot was not really needed but was quicker to get the animal down. There is no such thing as clean kill. Killing is not clean regardless of caliber. I have seen a 7mm Magnum butt shot deer and the deer did not go down because of a heavier bullet and more bullet energy. The point and reality is there will be miss shots sooner or later when hunting and some folks need to get used to that fact. Great hunt and good shooting.

We rescued them from our dog and brought them in our house.  I dropped a towel on them and they quickly calmed down.  We put them in our guest bathroom behind the shower doors in the bathtub.  We kept them for 2 weeks.  We fed them feeder mice starting with ""pinkies"" then ""fuzzies"".  Eventually, we upgraded their diet to ""hoppers"".  Just before we let the owls go, we fed them live small adult mice.  They gobbled them up.  We let the owls go a few days ago.  We thought we'd never see them again.  The very next night (to our delight) both of them returned to a tree nearest our house.  They were squawking like crazy standing side by side, wing to wing.

2294,uwOnFrfPRdE,"A lot of foals in the wild die this way actually... Stallions will kill foals who aren't fit to survive.

At the same time, though... If the foal is fit and healthy, stallions will keep the colt in the herd, even if it's not their own. They're not like cats who kill babies in cold blood as soon as they realize it's not their own, but they do it to keep the herd together and safe. Mares would destroy the herd to stay with a dying foal if they had the chance. The stallion was doing the herd a favor and the foal one so predators wouldn't come and kill it. Or if it lasted that long, die of starvation or disease.


Horses don't get ""jealous"" they have a smaller mindset and emotion span than humans do. The major instinct of a stallion, who runs the herd, btw... The lead mare guides them, but if a stallion wants to stop her, he does and makes the herd go in a different direction. Just most of the time he doesn't and protects the herd from behind, including adopting foals and colts under 2 into the herd themselves. They want to keep the herd large, they want to have as many eyes as possible and as many foals as possible even if they're not their own. Watch stallions interact with foals that aren't their own, even in the wild, they will act like it's their own. Predators kill off other males young mainly because they're at the top of the food chain, they get their genes spread faster. Hell, in some cases the males aren't even ALLOWED to kill the young because there's enough females to interfere. The non-pregnant females actually battle the pregnant/females caring for cubs for the chance of the babies of surviving in prides even if it's not the males cubs. But this allows new blood into the group for predators. For prey it lessens the chance of the herd/species surviving.",,,2.0,0.0,0,14778.0,541.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

That foal was unable to survive despite the assistance from both herds.

After checking the foal himself, he took the only action which was left to either stallion.  
It *was* a mercy killing, if something so brutal can be called that. But it was more a mercy for both bands than for the foal. 

I see this from time to time with brumby mobs, though typically brumby herds sharing space will work together to help a foal.

2333,xVgLDibDAog,"To me it seems that all carnivorous evolved to nothing else ..than serial murderers of the animal kingdom! - Since it's a fairly disconcerting matter, causing lots of confusion/ controversy, I did  a bit of deep philosophical pondering about what's right/ wrong in this regard:
I reckon evolution made all species (incl. us) choose an evolutionary path, for evolution is about changes/ adaptation for (mostly) the better! Hence, my observation and reasoning is that the evolution path of of humans progressed successfully, whereas the evolutionary path of carnivorous animals became outdated! It's a bit like with the lifestyle of murderers, because they too apply a lifestyle of morbid tactics in order to satisfy their perverse desires.
Im Brehms Tierleben I read that leopard enjoy falling into a blood rush...killing up to forty sheep only licking their blood without eating a bit of their flesh. The very same ""blood-rush"" behavior enjoy hyenas, by crushing the sculls of as many baby seal they encounter and then abandoning them.
Worst of all, many carnivorous animals now dismember their victims alive, for now they evolved into talented assassins!  Since their cruelty is unlimited, how can any animal-conservationist/ -lover support this type of behavior?
I don't know about you, but to me that says a lot about the evolution of carnivorous animals has gone wrong!! - Since their evolution misled them to virtually enjoy this morbid lifestyle, we (higher evolved species) are entitled to treat them, like we treat our mentally handicapped criminals, by locking them up in a safe, comfortable enclosure, such as zoos and parks, offering them veterinary care and security, where they won't harm anyone anymore. - There they live peacefully and longer, too (like me!) and are fed humanely slaughtered meat or meat of died animals.
For Millenniums the lifestyle of wild animals was correct, under the given conditions. Also, our human caveman mentality of hunters & gatherers was right, too.
The problem is that now the world has changed, rendering the lifestyle of wild animals increasingly unsustainable, because humans won the evolution race and need more space and natural resources.
Since the evolution of wild animals is unable to adapt to present conditions, we are the only specie able to help them to do so. - Thus now for animals it's a matter of change/ adapt or be changed!  I.e. they need to reduce their numbers to a sustainable level, which secures their survival and we offer them veterinary care and zoological gardens, where they live happier and longer. Our Labs are able to create antibiotics to save human lives and rescue wild animals. So, I suggest  not to rely on wild animals to rescue us, for they only enjoy torturing and devouring us piece by piece alive and then viruses finish them up, too. Feel free to ignore my insight and join the ranks of animal conservationists, who prefer to foster and perpetuate intolerable animal suffering. Incidentally, Isis fosters the same mentality...?",2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,17181.0,565.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The way feeders are made, they have plenty of red, yellow, and other assorted colors that Hummers are attracted to already incorporated in to them. At least your making your own nectar now, and Yes! That does save you a lot of 'Eagle Shit.'  Retired U.S. Marine.
Keep in mind that Feeder Maintenance is of paramount importance. You should wash your feeders at LEAST twice a week. I cleanse mine with every feeding/refill, and i also use a vinegar solution every two weeks. It removes all the excess stickiness form the sugary nectar, and also helps to eliminate the harmful bacteria's  that can build  up over time.
I have done pretty good with Hummers over the years. If you have any questions, Please feel free to ask, and Please do share as well.
One other helpful hand feeding idea that really works, but WATCH OUT!!   When you go out to have a  pleasant hand feeding session, put on a red shirt, but as i said;  WATCH OUT!!  You will get mobbed!!  Especially once your Hummers recognize you, which they will. They truly do have a memory, and they do remember who feeds, and cares for them.
HAVE FUN!!  Take care  and have a Safe & Blessed New Year!!!!
