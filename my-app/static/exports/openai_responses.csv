Sorry kid, but your side lost and wolves are about to die. The science supports management and the delisting, and the nuts have run out of emotional excuses.

Comment: Hi XB70Playboy.... about Internal Server Error, I used to get that all the time, and when I checked my "sent" messages, it showed about 100 names that it sent the message to.   In the last month, I am unable to send to all friends / contacts and have to select about 10 to 20 names at a time and then enter a text code.  After repeating the process three times it gives me a time out.... perhaps 20 minutes before I can continue.   It's  frustrating and I believe it's YouTubes' way of censoring.

Comment: I believe that wolves do play a role in the ecosystem, but like all predators, they need to be kept in check. The biologist and hunters know more about this than any polotician. People need to understand what healthy numbers are, and what role people must play in this matter. What happens when they over populate? I asked and so I will answer for you. They starve, spread disease, and exterminate other species.

Comment: Nationally, elk numbers grew 44%, from about 715,000 to over 1,031,000, between 1984 and 2009. 

In Montana, elk numbers increased from 90,000 in 1984 to 150,000 in 2009. In Idaho, where the hunters are crying the most over elk "decimation" due to wolves, the number of elk increased from 110 thousand to 115 thousand. 

Hunters kill more elk than any wolf ever has!

Comment: Wow! Necro much?

Actually if you are interested in the facts, they are easily available from the Id F&G dept. Their website if filled with studies from biologist.

There are many other sites and studies also, yet I try not to use them as the emotion based wolf nutters just disregard anything that doesn't "agree" with their predetermined emotional determination.

And I love seeing the new mothers bringing in their tiny new love back to visit and let the keepers have the well deserved privilege of touching the newborns. In this case it was especially important to Mulika as she was given sustenance when she needed it to keep her milk flowing to the baby--I am ever grateful to the Sheldricks  and family for their continued help and love of these elephants and welcoming so many!

Comment: It is good to know that these ex orphan mothers knew that they had a place to go in times of need. Also in my opinion, the ex orphan mothers who were about to give birth traveled purposely back to their keeper's place, to their home unfortunately on their way,  they could not hold it any more and gave birth, that is the explanation why when they finally came at their home, their baby was just 1 day or a few days old. They were not far away. Of course when giving birth, they preferred that their newly born calves were safe from predators so home territory is the ideal place, surrounded by their keepers ( human family ) and other elephants.  Ex orphans learned that they could count on their human family..so they keep on coming back, visiting, introducing their kids, asking for help etc.. They are also teaching their youngsters and their wild elephant friends about it.

Comment: I worked at the center for 2 month, and know Gertjie quite well, and I can tell that he is happy. People at HESC literally dedicate their life for the animals well been! if you had spend any time with rhinos, instead of just point fingers at other people , u would understand that they move their years constantly, as their vision is not very good, as most of the ruminants, so they depend on their audition, that is way his years move a lot, it happens even when he is fast asleep different than elephants that open their years to make themselves big and show a sine that they are under stressed and may attack.
Is to easy to just come and judge what other people r doing, way don’t u go read a little beat about rhinos, and how difficult is to rese a one of them, they need attention pretty much 24 hours a day, do u know how hard is to work the whole day, and at night spend a night at the stable waking up every 3 hours to feed Gertjie, do u know what is to be under the sun for 6 hours because Gertjie needs company? That is what the people At Hoedspruit Endangers species centre are doing, so please u that haven done any thing to help, don’t come here and say what u Think is write, is to easy to judge, the difficult thing is to take action and do some thing to save the rhinos as my friends at HESC are doing!

National Park response #1) There is some localized northward flow just to the east of S333, because the water level on the west of the L67 extension levee is higher than water level on the east. 

National Park response #2) The hydrology in the area is complicated, but we have been studying it for years and have a good handle on it.

What they won't tell you because they can't is how are they going to stop the South side from drying up during times of drought, water pollution, or when lock #334 is opened because they need water? The answer is with a 2.6 mile bridge you won't be able to.

People are finally starting to understand and it is very important for all of us to continue to watch & share this video as much as we can as we are the protecters of the Everglades.

Comment: I had John from the Sierra Club write me an email. Below you can read his email, and my response to him. Seems like when ever someone enquires about this video they get the same generic response with NO REAL ANSWERS to the problem. 

Below is the conversation.................................................................................................................................

Dear Mr. Harkness,

Thank you for contacting the Sierra Club. We took a look at your video and consulted with scientists at Everglades National Park. Your video actually demonstrates the need to restore flow across the central Everglades and elevate Tamiami Trail.

As you have documented, there is some localized northward flow just to the east of S333, because the water level on the west of the L67 extension levee is higher than water level on the east. Water levels are substantially lower in Northeast Shark Slough than western shark slough because of water management. This all part of the reason why we need to restore more natural flow by elevating the road. The net water flow through the culverts documented by the US Geological Survey since 1939 is north to south, and water will flow north to south as we redirect more water into Northeast Shark Slough under the 2.6 mile bridge.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Ullman
Senior Everglades Representative
Sierra Club

Hi Jonathan

I would like to thank you for writing me and taking the time to look into this.

Keep in mind the entire time since the 1 mile bridge has been built water has not flowed South underneath it.

Have Water Management and the National Park explain why they have not flowed water South? This is the first question we should have an answer too. We know it has not flowed South because we have checked it everyday since it's completion.

In the future when water is available we know the water will flow South. We agree with everybody about this point. But any time it is not flowed South the water will flow North due to not having enough water, being polluted, or during droughts. The bridges are going to allow the South Side to dry up in less than 24 hours during droughts and will cause a shock factor to local wildlife. Even during times when water is flowed South water levels will be so high that wildlife will not have land, and the excessive amounts of water will rot the vegetation destroying our ecosystem.
This leads to the second question that needs to be asked and answered. How does Water Management and National Park stop the Northern water flow underneath all this bridging when lock 334 opens and water is flowed South East of the lock, and when lock 333 is closed? This will create a vacuum suction drying out the South Side. A better solution they should look into is putting locks in the place of the 2.6 mile bridge area. This will prevent Northern water flow, and have more control over the water while achieving the Southern water flow in times of need. This scenario might not be as pretty as the view from the top of the concrete bridge, but it sure will save the South side of the Everglades from flooding, and loss of wildlife.This is not something you just slap together because you get some taxpayer money. 

Sierra Club if you truly care about the Everglades you will get answers for these specific questions and scenarios.

Not only the pollution and misdirection of water the extended hydro-period caused by stacking the polluted water is have adverse impacts throughout the system.
For as long as I can remember despite all the comments and information provided by very knowledgeable people the agencies ignore common sense and science continue abuse our public lands, spend money foolishly on whatsoever pet project the agencies wish to support

Comment: Update: The 333 Lock was opened allowing the L29 Canal to rise up to 6.8' allowing water to flow South. The water level on the West side of the 333 Lock was at 9.8'. The 334 Lock on the East end of the L29 Canal was closed.

However, we tested the water flow underneath the New 1 Mile Bridge and it was still not flowing South as it was intended to do even though the water table was raised.

It is great news that the water is flowing South today. The culverts radius is small and the water gets pushed through with pressure for it to travel South. This is a fact that Water Management knows about it. Another good thing about the culverts is you can block the water from flowing back North in case there is not enough water to send South, High Pollution, or in times of Droughts. If you put in place a 2.6 Mile Bridge you will have no way to control the water from coming back North. You also have to keep in mind when they open the 334 Lock to send water to the farms it's going to suck the water out from the South through the 2.6 Mile Bridge drying out the South side over night and there will be no way to stop it! 

Here are some questions taxpayers should be asking the Everglades National Park:

1) Where will you get enough water to flow South all the time?
2) How will you clean the water pollution fast enough?
3) How will you stop the water from flowing back North when you do not have enough water or when it's polluted?
4) Are you going to sacrifice the delicate Eco-System on the South side by drying it up overnight each time the farmer's need water?

Instead of a bridge they should consider a lock to control the water or clear out the existing culverts and to put more focus on cleaning the water.

Comment: I am from the Azores islands and have had pigeons all my life. We do not have falcons there. Have been living in California for 45 years and have had 13 different breeds of pigeons. The ones I have that have been able to escape a falcon,  not all the times, is a cross breed. I have crossed a Turkish Kelebek with a Birmingham roller and a Portuguese tumbler. I call it Portuguese rollerbecks. They summersault, dive, zig-zag but still once in a while they are a meal for the peregrine falcon. The escampadissa pigeon from the island of Majorca, to my knowledge, is the only pigeon that can outsmart a falcon, but again not all the times.

Comment: I love pigeons. They are some of the most beautiful birds out there. I once raised a coop of roller pigeons and it's amazing to see how they fly when falcon chased them. My pigeons dived and sped like a bullet from the sky. My diver pigeon dropped 1000ft from the sky all the way down home. One falcon target my yellow pigeon, however, she dived so fast and swoop up into the sky like a missile, the falcon couldn't catch her. I was so amazed to see how fast pigeons can be. They are lovely birds.

Comment: Well Josh, ur in a great area for good deer that's for sure .. Number 1) stay warm.  Nothin worse than trying to shoot a bow while ur cold.  Also, don't wear bulky clothes, they will interfere with shooting ... make sure to practice shooting with EXACTLY what you will be wearing so u know what to expect.  Other than that, watch the wind, ur scent, and aim small, miss small ... wait for the right shot ... it's not worth losing a deer over rushing a shot.   Best of luck!!!

Comment: @ToxicWorld75 As mentioned in the video.  Although it may look bad, the strange skin condition you see affecting this rhino seems to cause no harm to them at all.  The skin of a rhino is at least 10x thicker than that of a human and forms an incredibly strong barrier against the rough and tumble of life in the bush.  If you would like to know more about this particular parasitic infection drop us an email and we will give you some links.

Comment: @mistulac Hi there...The "tail up" posture you see in this video is more of an alarm signal - nothing to do with its need to defecate. In general, this specific posture normally indicates alarm or sexual responsiveness. Either way, it is probably not a good idea for a human to approach the animal if this signal is displayed. An uneasy or horny rhino is not a safe rhino! :)

Doctors stop people's hearts multiple times during open heart surgery literally killing them momentarily. All these guys did was cause her to lose her breath for a bit.

After two years in the rains of equatorial climate and termite attacks, the mirror was replaced by a mirror with aluminum frame 150x180, frame included. As the first mirror was in fair condition, it was placed a little further, oppositely oriented to the road, and so to double the opportunity of image of self. It was covered with three mirrors 58x120 cm, because the bottom of small mirrors became "rusty”

And why is it that whenever I comment on these issues the name calling starts?  Who's ignorant here? Really, ask yourself. Have I called you names and insulted you in any way?

But when you passionately say "they're just scared" what do you suggest the people do then? Stand there and say "Well, we are in their land, so I guess we'll have to let yogi here kill us." Don't you see that's absurd? Even if the humans WERE the trespassers, we still have the right to protect ourselves right?

Comment: @CyprusHot Well you should not use the LORD's name in a sarcasm or a joke. Also that verse is out of context because that verse is referring to an animal owned by some one (a domestic animal or cattle)as it says "...cares for the needs of HIS animal..." Therefore it does not apply to wild animals who are threatening humans. Also, in 1 Samuel 17:34-37 killing wild animals in self-defense is justified.

If you get any of that spray on your hands and rub your eyes boy does it burn! I pepper sprayed a black bear in our carport this summer and some of the overspray got on the handlebars of my wifes bike. Had to scrub hard with soapy water to get it all off. Glad I noticed it before she did.

Comment: Silly comments. First off congrats you two are still alive.  Second there is no shame just shooting a charging bear.  There is no need to check off a list of bear spray or not. You have an animal capable and intending to rip you apart when they are charging. So shoot the damn thing between the eyes without batting an eyelash. If you survive to tell the tale, good for you.  So many are not so lucky.  Bears are not bad, they are bears, and they are wild.  There is no fairytale story.  If you are getting charged from a brown bear that is not a good thing at all for you. And yes mankind can still enjoy wildlife and these amazing creatures taking all precautions to prevent this type of thing to occur. Even with taking all necessary precautions, this can still happen. Thankfully the two here were prepared so they can live to tell the tail.

In this instance idc if she charged, it serves you both right!!! This is why bears are disappearing. And most likely you weren't even making noise you probably were quiet the whole time and the woofing was her warning and yet these bullheaded humans didn't heed it and she charged as a result. Then they turned on the camera and said let's upload a video to YouTube to cover our asses. Now two cubs have to go without a mother, I hope you live with that and see there faces every time you close your eyes.

Comment: @LisaErinBrown I think this may happen. I hope we can show You Tube land something new. Two people meet on You Tube and record every bit of their experiences getting to know each other, physically getting to each other and the experiences they have. I'm going to make a response to your video soon. What happened to the blond hair? LOL! Bear.

Comment: .... I wonder if it would be possible to build a nest for the Horn Bill and would the birds use them.........We might be able to attract the birds with plenty of food and water and their own credit card. We live in the mangroves located about 2 or 3 hours by motobike and boats from Koh Kong Cambodia. There are flocks of Horn Bill birds here. I have no idea where they roost at night. Maybe a hotel...............If the chicks grow up in a home made birds nest, they might return next season.

Comment: Thumbs down for taking such a long shot. No respect for the animal. You owe it to the animals you hunt to take a more ethical shot. It didn't matter to you if you made a clean kill or not, you just took a chance.  It would be different if it was already wounded and you were trying to put it down to take this shot.  If you are going to post a video, get a tripod or learn to hold the camera still.

What I loved the most is Kevin giving them his back as a step so that they could get down from the truck...that reminded me of my cat. I did the same when he couldnt get down on his own somewhere high. It seems size doesn't matter. You love them anyway

Comment: Buffalo! Buffalo! Buffalo! I live in Buffalo, and I have never seen a buffalo besides the fake ones that are put along the thruway. Hahaha It must have been so cool to see them up close! Maybe about 5 years back the city had a thing where they made Buffalo statues (like the one you are standing next to) and painted them all different ways. Then they sold them to benefit a charity. Now you can see them scattered around town in different areas. Great video chris!

It is breathtaking to see all of it. It looked like one of the buffalo's head was injured. And also there were so many young buffaloes - so wonderful!

Comment: The second lizard is a leopard lizard. The red spots on the side mean it is a female and when the spots are bright like that it usually means it is close to laying eggs. If this is the blunt nose leopard it is endangered but I believe it wasnt. Awesome videos by the way. I live in Reno and I love hiking and exploring too. If you ever want to look at stuff around here you absolutely have access to maps trails and a place to stay if you need it.

Comment: You didn't see a fawn because of the date on the video said it's in the end of may. Deer usually give birth to their fawns in may or june and for the first couple of weeks they hide very well and don't follow their mothers around very much until they're a little older. The population of deer in wisconsin is fine predation by humans is WAY higher from humans than by predators anyways

I told her to stop eating my flowers or I was going to turn off the sprinkler. She looked at me, stepped out of the garden and pulled her babies away.Then they immediately layed down in the grass and we got the most beautiful pictures of them. One picture is on our channel as wallpaper. I think she was responsive to me because I turned the sprinkler on for them earlier.

I think they liked each others company:)  These are neighborhood moose and they are use to dogs, children  and yes even adults telling them to get out of the garden.  We purposely planted flowers that moose do not eat. That was the only time a moose has ever tried to eat that plant. Thanks for your post!

Comment: @leotheguido No, the moose are generally comfortable in the yard.  Mother's bring their young almost immediately after they are born to neighborhood yards to eat.  The mother is very protective the first week . After that she is back to eating and building her stores back up from the previous winter.  As long as we are not teasing or bothering them they don't bother us.  Even dogs incessantly barking doesn't usually bother them unless the dog tries to nip at them.  Thanks for the post!

Comment: I enjoyed watching this squirrel, while it was feeding on the banana. I love its face - so cute, especially in close-up range. Like all squirrels it looks so adorable. I love the munching part with the music - so funny... It's really a big one  squirrel and very unusual in this respect. It cannot be as fast as other small squirrels are and it could be a problem for surviving. Thank you for this wonderful video. Have a happy and joyful week, my Dear Menu. Much Love and Hugs, my35Xvision. :)

Comment: Although he looks a little arthritic, it is amazing how good lucking this tiger is. Even for animals, it is rare that such an old one does not show very noticeable cosmetic deterioration. Much love to you guys for keeping him in good shape, and making sure he's comfortable in his later years. He must have quite a lot of stories from his early days.

Comment: Flavio is a retired circus tiger and to the best of our knowledge he's 23 years old! This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful "purrsonality" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :) The exact precise date isn't known.

Comment: This beautiful video made me cry. At first I was crying because of the horrible cruelty and exploitation that these beautiful cats have experienced, but then I started crying tears of joy that Flavio (and all of the other critters that are in your care) finally gets to experience the beauty and happiness that they deserve. Although it is sad that Flavio isn't here on earth with us anymore, it is so very comforting that he got to spend his "retirement years" in a place where people loved and cared for him and made his life so enriching and happy. You can see the joy in his eyes when he is running around and playing, like he finally was able to be a tiger. I am so grateful that there are people like those at Big Cat Rescue who dedicate their time and lives to give these extraordinary animals the happiness and respect that they deserve.

Plus maintenance of that many enclosures that are submerged into the lake would be time consuming as well, all of our tigers have access to at least one pool, Flavio has two :)

Comment: Thanks ever so much for this. I have a nursing vixen that visits me daily (more than once a day sometimes) for food. I'm really looking forward to seeing her cubs, but her earth is just out of sight from my garden and so I'm still waiting. They are nearly nine weeks old now, so maybe they are a bit bigger than these ones - wouldn't mind knowing how old these ones are if anyone has a good idea. I'm probably not going to see them until they start to wander a bit more - but at least now I can see what I'm missing. Thanks again.

They are nearly nine weeks old now, so maybe they are a bit bigger than these ones - wouldn't mind knowing how old these ones are if anyone has a good idea. I'm probably not going to see them until they start to wander a bit more - but at least now I can see what I'm missing. Thanks again.

Comment: NYGdeerslayer42, you're entitled to your opinions. This was Nate's best buck with a bow and it was the right deer to take out of the herd. The Swithblade broadheads the Outdoor Insights Team have been using are the most accurate broadheads we've ever used. Our Zero Detect Camo also works well for us. You use what you want and we'll keep using what works.

Comment: Did you read the description? The person who posted this video is helping the animals. People who make a business of abusing endangered species want their actions to be as hidden from the public eye as possible- that helps them abuse more animals. We need the opposite of what you suggest. We need Youtube to post as many videos about animal abuse as possible, to expose the truth. It's the only way to educate the public, and encourage people to help.

Comment: Hun, I just want to say that yes, hunting is natural though hunting babies is not. God put the animals here for us to eat. Though he didn't put them here for psycho's to torture. I do believe in hunting for it stops over population and the spread of disease. I personally don't hunt because I cannot look an animal in the eye and proceed to shoot it. I would personally want to take it home and keep it as a pet or enjoy watching it run free. :):)  Clarification: Hunt for food, not for sport!

Comment: I loved the video even though I hunt. I cherish all life, and only hunt for food, and not sport. I hunt because it is more viable to support my family, and I only use a rifle, no bait or calls or traps. Still great video. :)

Comment: I'll say it again..not many hunters are like you.  Eating meat is a choice.  Videos like this are just to try to help people make truly educated choices & to know what goes into the meat on their tables.I don't slam my friends who eat meat.I do try to inform them in ways I can to make choices for organic meats grown on private farms & processed at private places.  The private ones kill only maybe 30 animals a day tops, & they do it humanely.I would protect my own dog just as you did, by the way.

Comment: If we want to live in a society that fully satiates the needs of the collectivity, we must guide ourselves by the "Natural Laws" What's a natural law? explained in simple steps: Care for the comunity as a superior entity, care for the self as a minor entity.
By extention of comunity and with more reason considering we call ourselves rational, we should care for the OTHER living beings too as a part of the global comunity, avoiding their harm at all costs.

Having worked in a medical setting with patients dying in front of me, I learned how to deal with that. But this, this seems more than the heart can take.

Comment: Okay; to the ones crying bloody murder, the hyenas are probably fine. The visitors probably expected to hear them 'laughing', so not having them laugh is a poor show on the handler's part. Unlike what you think, the hyenas don't pay a nightly fee to stay in the park: it is paid for by visitors, who will also recommend the park to friends or take others along.

Comment: Lovely!!!  I had a big grin on my face the whole time watching them enjoy themselves!!  So happy that after all of the undeserved sadness in their lives, they were blessed to find peace in Tennesse!  While watching this video, the only thing that would have made it better is if I had been able to hear what they were hearing---splashing, birds singing, and may a few ele-notes of pure pleasure!  Thank you thank you thank you for all you do for them.

Comment: I live in NZ, in a rural environment, where we have hares (like the one in this video), rabbits, weasels (ferrets) and stoats. It is highly unusual to see what I think is a stoat, the smallest of the mustelids in NZ, going for prey as large as a hare. It must have been very hungry, or had a litter to feed. This is a very good film catch - well done! [Hear the call of the shining cuckoo in the background?] People ask why it bites the back of the neck. Mostly to avoid getting kicked and raked by the legs of its prey, also to avoid being bitten.

I live next to the area where the owl is and people are getting way to close and I am sure the owl has to be annoyed at the fact that people won't leave him alone long enough to hunt. His eye should be on his food source not on human because people are there from daylight to dark, people are actually driving his food source away by walking on his hunting grounds... people are climbing fences etc to get to him...STOP just my opinion.

I never hunted so I have so many questions. :D I thought that you would make a sled out of sticks and take it to your car or something. :D
Oh oh and also - why do hunters aim for a heart, not the brain? Is it because the skull is so durable?

Comment: I am surprised that more Hunters are not using the Ultra Magnums especially the 7mm RUM it is so accurate , both 7mm and 300 RUM are Super Accurate Calibers and Rifles .  There is another Rifle called the 28 Nosler , it is The 7mm RUM it is a 404 Jeffery Necked down to 284 , that is exactly what the 7mm RUM is ,  I would want to stand a 7mm RUM next to a 28 Nosler to see what the exact difference is in height .

Comment: Those King parrots are so gorgeous! I went crazy over the wild birds in Oz. Every morning waking up to the  kookaburra's and sulphur crested cockatoos. My favorites, the lorikeets. I couldn't help but noticed the minor birds attacking the kookaburra's all of the time. Why do they do that? Are they looking for easy food? I swear this one in the backyard wanted to kill the kookaburra while it was trying to sleep. It kept flying and pecking at it's poor head.  Loved this video.

Comment: I ran into a large bear (It was brown in color, at least on the back, but it must have been a black bear) on the back side of Cascade in '92 or so.  We had stopped to pick some berries in a ravine, and noticed we weren't the only ones enjoying the harvest.  It was at the top of the ravine maybe 15 yards away gingerly eating the berries.  I motioned to my buddy, and we both silently agreed he needed the berries more then we did.  We slowly backed up and took the long way around (I now know that was probably not the best strategy, but it worked).  The bear never seemed to notice us.  Since then I had a chance to see many larger Brown Bears even closer at the Katmai bear camp in Alaska, which was awesome, but somehow running into that bear in Utah stands out in my mind.

Comment: Not as cool as yours but I had a bizarre experience once with a hummingbird
I was probably, 13 or so and lived by Shawnigan lake on southern Vancouver Isalnd which is rural. Anyways, it was spring or early summer and I was burning some trash in a barrel in the yard wearing my bright red baseball jacket. This jacket had stainless steel buttons. So,I am burning the garbage when I see this hummingbird fly maybe 5 feet away and about 2 feet above my head.making its distinctive hum, its just staring at me as its sitting there(flying). Well, I guess it though I was some motherload feeder,lol, because it came right up and stuck its beak into one of the steel buttons(the female one had a small hole straight through), realizing there was zip in that one it reversed to find the other button below and tried again but still no sweet syrope to be had then it did a final back away, stop, stare and buzzed away.

Comment: Lot's of comments from people who have never been in the bush.
The guide was brilliant. 
Yes you can smell when they are in Musth, but only if your down wind of them.
Watch the video again, when they came across the Elephant, he was in the shade with his back to them, you couldn't see the fluid on his cheeks, you couldn't see leakage from below because his legs hid it and your up wind of him.
It isn't until we get a side on of his face do we see he is in Musth, Stretch notices, a few moments later he explains. 
This was an extraordinary example of bushmanship.
He remained calm, put his life in the firing line to protect his party. He did exactly what was necessary. 
Lot's of negative comments below about what he should and shouldn't do, did any of them spot he was in Musth when they first spotted him?
All came home save. Professional job. This is Africa, not a theme park.

Comment: We do not go out looking for cats. These are cats that were abandoned, abused, neglected, discarded etc. Cheetah's are harder for people to get as pets. That means there are not usually any being discarded.  So it is a good thing that we don't have any cheetahs. It means there aren't many kept as pets to be discarded.

Comment: After two years of shooting, thousands of miles of driving, tens of hours editing, and countless miles hiked, cliffs scaled, and rivers forded I have finally finished the time-lapse video you all have been seeing me post frames of for the past few years. All footage was shot in National Parks and includes shots from Grand Teton,Glacier, Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain, Bryce Canyon, and Shenandoah National Park.  #nationalpark   #GlacierNationalPark   #BryceCanyon   #Shenandoah   #grandteton  #milkyway

Comment: Awesome video. Is it rare to have so many albino deer in your area? There must be a law against shooting them as I assume they would be a lot easier to spot than a regular deer when there isn't snow on the ground. I also see there tarsal glands are stained brown. I would guess a regular deers tarsals are stained too but I've never noticed against there brown hide. Again nice video.

You guys interested in a house cat that thinks she's a big cat?  Mine's been reeeeaaaaaaally trying the the patience of everyone in the house the last two weeks.  I think my dog is plotting a way to rub her out without the blame being put on him.  I think locking her up in a big cage with a tiger or lion may very well put her in her place :P

Comment: Can you start sharing if these animals actually recover and are able to go free again? Or if they have to stay in care or unfortunately don't make it. I'm left wondering what has happened to this little guy. Thank you for showing the vets work as well.  You are such an amazing man to take care and save these animals from such scarry situations. God bless you

Comment: i have grown up watching wildlife documentaries and seen a thousand predator prey hunt videos but this is by the far the most astonishing and amazing thing ever.  Considering that the impala was 4 ft tall,  that branch where the leopard jumps from has got to be atleast 30 feet tall.  A jump from that height could severely bruise, fracture or kill us.  The way it dives its head upside down but yet lands on its feet is amazing use of the tail for balance and dynamics. Damn i can't believe this beautiful agile animal will be extinct from earth in the next 30 years.

Maybe the camera made a noise or looked interesting and that's why the bobcat looked. Felines are curious and alert and can hear very well so if the camera makes the slightest sound before snapping the picture the cat will look. You people's comments are so useless and unfounded, especially McPrfctday's.

Comment: I had some cattle panels and green metal fence posts that I used to temp fence areas like that lush growth behind the area you have them in. I could take it up and move it around easily and hammer in the posts with my soft ground I had. I rotated them around, cross fencing, and they had forage almost all year (Southeast Texas). I had a couple too many for the areas they worked, so I did provide some hay and some feed for mine on a regular basis, too. 

They cleaned their areas up to about five feet high of low branches. I had barbados. I loved them. Beautiful quiet lawn mowers and tree trimmers. They kept it very nice around the pond and kept all the fence rows clean. 

Since this was from 2011, they likely have cleared all your land by now, though. 

That barbado cross you had there was certainly a beautiful animal.

Comment: Gates of the Mountain Boat Ride
The Gates "Verticle Stone" site on the Missouri River
I didn't realize that there was a specific point on the river that identified what Lewis wrote.
"these clifts rise from the waters edge on either side perpendicularly to the height of 1200 feet." ...  

... "I called it the gates of the rocky mountains" Captain Lewis wrote on July 19, 1805
Nearby is the Mann Gulch 1949 forest fire site, 12 smokejumpers died.
Really glad I finally did the boat tour. This place is the tour's end and return home.
Up river in 1979, I worked at the Coulter Campground site.

... "I called it the gates of the rocky mountains" Captain Lewis wrote on July 19, 1805
Nearby is the Mann Gulch 1949 forest fire site, 12 smokejumpers died.
Really glad I finally did the boat tour. This place is the tour's end and return home.
Up river in 1979, I worked at the Coulter Campground site.

Comment: @OrpheusonRS I think until to try wearing a lumpy backpack that weighs 5KG's and contains this chair hide you'll realise it does feel quite heavy. Thing is the camera gear also weighs a few more KG's and it all adds up. Due to my transport limitations and location limitations I've not bothered using the chair hide and since aquired a a stealthwildlife bag hide. It weighs much less as it's just mesh material all be it quite heavy duty and is much easier to carry around over the shoulder.

This could help interested folks in keeping up to date or in touch with developments. Also add how on can visit Lewa, and or contribute in some way - fiscally or otherwise. Again thanks so much

I just picked up the Horton Hunter 175 last week and already, it's seen some action. As a new shooter, you'll have questions and I can help with most if you need someone to help you out. I'm pretty sure I have more crossbow hunting experience than any other living soul right now. LOL! Been doing this a long time. Good Hunting and have fun down under!

Comment: Great video and can learn a great lesson out of this. You can always vanquish your fiercest enemies, if you know how to play the right moves.
What a brave buffalo this is.  Sheer underdog, makes an escape from the brink of being devoured. Wow! we need to remind ourselves
that there always is hope, even in the face of danger.  I vouch for the underdog, so was very thrilled to see the buffalo escape.

People like you and I, and probably a lot of these people watching these videos...the uproar would be so enormous it would not happen. But, I understand your point and agree that we need to tread carefully if we want to preserve these beautiful creatures and their habitats.

Comment: Control is understood from a human perspective. Even if I'm willing to grant that the ecosystem has natural processes to regulate the population of animals, which seems dubious, any natural process is generally not going to correspond to any human interest. Hence the need for artificial population control.

Comment: For everyone who has questions as to why Bear hunting in Alberta is both legal, ethical and needed:  In 1982, the government of Alberta published Fish and Wildlife Policy for Alberta which provides policy goals and a framework for the management of bears. Comprehensive plans for bears were formulated in 1990 (grizzlies) and 1993 (black bears).

Generally, the plan concluded that Alberta's population was healthy and in no danger of overexploitation. The objectives emphasized that the current population should be maintained, that hunting harvests for Albertans and non-residents could be locally increased, that more nuisance bears be translocated, and that research be continued.
 Where populations are adequate, high-quality recreational hunting could be encouraged particularly in areas where it might contribute to a reduction in the incidence of problems. Additionally, the significance of black bear predation of moose and other northern ungulates needs to be determined.

Comment: There are only a few places in Alberta where you can set up baits. There are differing opinions for sure about baited hunts. However, these areas are very over poplulated and setting up baites helps to ensure the proper management of bears. it also ensures sows and cubs aren’t killed because the shooter gets a good look first. with 40,000 black bears in Alberta, all styles of hunting are needed to keep the bear population under control.

We try to educate people that we can co-exist with these beautiful creatures but sadly our government don't share our opinions and are allowing country towns permits to disperse them plus they will euthanize the pups in the trees after dispersal which is just heartbreaking!

You'd think with all that orange, they'd stick out like a stop sign, but when I visited Shambala Preserve in September, you could not see the tigers in the shade!  I took some pictures that were "I THINK there was a tiger in there" and finally messed with the exposure before I could see them!  They're beautiful.

Comment: The AZA has banned the breeding of/for white tigers in AZA accredited zoos. That should say something. To see the complete research go to BigCatRescue org and click on the navigation menu item "Big Cat Photos and Facts". The page you are taken to has a list of big cat species. Scroll down that list and click on the "White Tigers" link. From there read all the pages discussing this issue. If you really have an interest in the facts, you will be glad you took the time to study that information.

Comment: This may be what you are referring to: The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.

Comment: This was emotional & EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE!!! I always say a prayer at night to St. Francis Of Assisi,(Patron Saint Of Animals) not only for my own pet cat Sandy that is going through a small, but god willing fully healable crisis of his own but for also all the Big Cats out there in the wild & captivity, as well as the blessed soldiers on staff & volunteers down at Big Cat Rescue every single night! Anyone who <3's cats should do the same, regardless of religious beliefs! Thank You! :D

Comment: I suggest a nice savage accu-trigger rifle in .17 HMR.  Since you want to hunt crows the .17 HMR will allow you to knock them off at longer ranges as they can be difficult to approach.  Squirrels are easier to get close to, especially in dense foliage but if you only wound it they have a tendency to hide in places you can't get them out of and thus lose the meat.  The HMR solves this because when I head shot my squirrels it removes almost the entire head.  Be safe and good hunting.

Comment: We live in a sick evil society, and these cowardly bully Sociopaths are the sickest ones of all. People who like to hurt harmless animals for fun are psychos and losers. They should be institutionalized because these are the same creeps who end up shooting human beings. Squirrels are intelligent and friendly animals, but these animal torturers are Vermin.

Comment: This was probably the manner early man interacted with other beasts, so every one here hating on the dogs should note that human society has more in common with the close bonding of the dog pack than the sedentary leopard. And to reaffirm despite many finding it hard this dominance displayed by the dogs reflects just how group mentality allowed us to reach a stage today when we don't have to sit around at night by the fire watching the perimeter with the fear that a wildcat would attack.

Summary of Jenny's Necropsy:
 The immediate cause of Jenny's death was a bacterial sepsis. A pre-existing knee injury that brought her to the Sanctuary is suspect of being the origin.

Comment: long..but please..let me share. i truly feel ..well i hope. 
this makes me cry. shirley and jenny..
they also bonded with others..shirley still does..i love shirley so much..
and i love jennu so much.
thier love for each other is ….so ..beautiful. i saw when they met after all those years..since the terrible..circus  :( 
but..happiness …so profound. i know shirley loves many..but her and jenny.. not just mother and child..but friendship so profound..and such deep deep love for each other. i just am sad for all her past..but the breeding place..-or whatever..that made her life so so short. but!
happiness does wonders. and i know shirley tarra..others had to make sure she didn't overdo her fun playing!! 
that…THAT makes me know…she let go of the past..and found her life again. i want to learn about  each and all the elephants here. still will jenny and shirley. …i can't imagine the loss. but..the support is beautiful. then i want to follow shirley to meet others..and tarra..and bella the dog…is another i really want to watch. 
such graceful..gentle..so intelligent..and thoughtful. bonds that will hold them forever. i hope ..i can't stand all the killing for tusks. but…also-the circus..and all other--rtiding ..why??? torture is so unbearable. i almost want that end first..-circuses and all the mean treatment. tho..losing them..to poachers…is scary. tusks?? carvings? big deal! i am an artist. there are SO many wonderful things to carve…non-living things. 
even wood..but AFTER the tree is gone. ot ..whatever. -but..marble..-so much stuff. 
what is it about ivory. yes..that you can't have it..is the want. -but the can't have..is not a challenge thing..-it is about killing! wake up people. please. elephants are so so incredible. i love all species..-all amazing lives..-so much to learn..we ..can learn much more with respect and seeing all a like us. we are a species too. who is to say what "intelligence"is. they don't destroy the world. or hate etc. humans are …beautiful-no doubt there…a wonderful species. -but..intelligence isn'teven just the brain.. the mind! senses…feelings…nerves…hormones..all play a role..and so so so so many infinite things. that cross over..-endless network of ..BEING, LIFE. LIVING. 
but happiness is known by all in some way or another. 
jenny..life is not always in numbers. but..it is true..you had it hard. it makes me pray for nosey..hoping she will have some life..too. but..jenny..you found your life…that is what it is all about. and..i love this place. thank you all for being there sorry long. this is my special thing for jenny..and to shirley. but also tarra and others i don't know yet..who were close to jenny. and then../to follow shirley! 
it is sucha GREAT happiness for me--even tho i read someones words below about shirley keeps losing friends..but continues to have support..and make other close close friends. i am so looking forward to all stories. i wish i could buy a set..or something. -and add to it as more come out. no money-but i'd save up-if it goes to the sanctuary! 
but shirley seems..from only 3 videos..but-or 2? --but reading also. -
thing is..i sense shirley is almost like the matriarch. but also..one who needs too. who is a child also..who needs that childhood. i hope to find that here. i feel great love for her. and i know i will love all. jenny is so deep in my heart. 
and i know..feel it..jenny is forever shirley great love. not just as child..but as -bonded love. friendship love..that is profound. yes..being part of each other. mother child..but..where shirley also.. even tho..she knew..and always protected jenny. she also was there to see her play. yet ..a true mother. but..i remember when shirley was lying in the water..just…happy..but still struggling with getting up.. and jenny was playing and so so happy..but when shirley spoke..i wonder what..-its likefeelings..and more. communication..but-so amazing. but…jenny knew sshirly was still so so crazy-happy to be with her and jenny with shirley the same--it was stll so fresh..and always--ijust know..and-jenny(i think it was jenny in the water..saw it 3 or 4 ..or 5 times!…but-i think jenny in water..heard shirley..wanting to be with her-sounding to her speaking..feeling out-and trying to get up..and dong it..i am sure she got stronger with time..but-always..:( crippled like many from the terrible .. but.. -jenny went right to her..even before shirley got up..
she was right there. like she was the mom..-the one right away ..hearing shirley ask for her-or simlar-and so slowly got up..and jenny right there.. and then, oh how they use there trunks to communicate so so much. it is so much to want to watch and learn.. but. feel! it is easy to see why thier love was forever …immortalized in a way. but shirley is still here..and -oh..please be here …for as long as you live. i feel happiness in shirley differently. i feel..getting to be there for jenny was HUGE! but..i somehow sense..it is a deep gift in her. to feel a special deep empathy ..for others. 
and jenny..10 years..i knownot long long for an elephant..but a lot of time-if happy…and more. longerif tortured..but time is not alive then-in how i think. it is alive when happy..and when finding happiness. both..and more. but never bad stuff. i again..look forward to these stories. i also want to read about the place. special place. and whomever -1 or more does the filming..wonderfully done. they can be free here. -and i love this place. 
i feel such deep love for elephants and lions. -since a little little kid. "born free"..--well-loved lions even before--but..that film. was-my ..? but..i also knew of elephants..and ever since..the two..in different ways..but love so profound and one never stronger than the other. -and cats. -abd dogs. but cats. i lived with 3 loves. i know if one day a dog is with me and a cat or whatever..-i will love the same. but.. this is about jenny.  Jenny..you had such great love all around you ..that it let you be a child again..-i think. -just from what little i read..but ..i know..i felt -feel still.. your happiness.you made beautiful friends..and -youmet shirley. and you two together found your sense of being as well..i just feel that. you got to be free! jenny..i am so happy for you for that. many don't make it. or make it long enough to find it long enough..for it to bloom and grow.. and become the love that brought out your special gift..as well as shirleys. and others..i kow..but i tsee tarra has bella..and another elephant..-becomes her friend -i just saw .. 
was looking for jenny and shirley..but-i follow what someone else asked and got info. i need to follow them first. then shirley..as well as tarra..and more. -just go with it. i am thrilled that shirley is happy..i saw she sort of recently had a 65th! i believe shirley loves life..and-wants so much to live..as they all do..-sorry so long. no more like this. please know. i needed to …write this. thank you all.  jenny..you are blessed..and i am grateful and so happy..you got your life..and shirley-so wise and intelligent ..knows that. and loves you always. you gave each other anextra bonus in life..happiness..and true love. love isn't always just..-as humans see it. it is much more. and humans knowit in them too..but..are not as open. but..some are. but again..for jenny..and shirley..because it is hard to separate you two..tho your girts for life and love are so different and so equally profound. you certainly have your own . as does shirley. ijust..thought..an RIP..is not it. it is ..yes. celebrating jenny. and jenny-i still have much to learn. the hard..i know..i wont want to…but i will. it is you. and all others too. i want to know all here. jenny. i am so happy you found your life..and how beautiful..amazing and profound it all..-was..and is. you loved life as a child. picked up from where left off..but you also were a tremendously gifted adult who truly ..i just sense..-i ? but what so far..-you spark happiness and childhood and life in others! but you also have thatbeautiful deep gift to bond. and -that you and shirley both have that..and found each other again..and likely helped each other ..-but. back to finding your lives. ..you found yours..as did shirley. you lived it with such passion..felt by so many. i just know. and shirley too.
tho you both are such individuals finding your greatest most profound inner and outer being in yourselves. individuals yes. but the other gift just as profound…was you and shirley. shirley and you. it made 10+ years a full lifetime …bless you jenny. you are one beautiful elephant. one beautiful girl. and ..i can't wait til tomorrow eve to watch more!  i wish i could visit the sanctuary. or help there. talk about a dream :) anyway. with love,  jenny your celebration showed someone i can't wait to see more -you..and you and shirley..and others!!! others too! bonds are meant to be shared with all..to include ..to live and love. a special video. i have to find out if there is a way to buy these stories..as they are. money for the sanctuary! i know many would buy them. (hint hint )  ;)  goodnight sweet girl. …i love you. i do. i love you , Jenny. <3 <3

Comment: Ok, love all your videos. We're friends on A.T. Now, watching the slow mo shots, and watching your shot placement VS the deer diving. I'm wondering how far are these shots? 25-30yds? I'm wondering their fast reaction if i should start aiming 4" lower then I do.

Comment: Because if not we would have trophy hunters “sustainably use” every single endangered or critically-endangered animal on this planet, and more often than not the most endangered of all groups of animals, that we paradoxically don’t really care or think about, either, are the ones they don’t want as trophies. For example in South Africa where *legal, regulated* hunting has actually saved some of the species being targeted like lions and white rhinos (which, I’ll admit I hate with a passion, too, and I’ve often gotten into heated arguments with trophy hunting proponents on the Internet despite the fact that it helps support poor local people there, as well. None of us are perfect), however, penguins living in the southernmost parts of the country, as well as in Namibia, are still very much endangered and in decline, and guess what? Sport hunters don’t want them in their collections, even though, once again, *legal and well-regulated* hunting has saved the “Big Five” in South Africa, thus it’s sort of a slap-in-the-face to us at least interested in working in properly-accredited zoos and aquariums where we work with captive-bred birds in order to at least have a viable breeding population. 

Turtles and tortoises also aren’t usually targeted by the industry, either, and yet, statistically-speaking, *they’re the most endangered group of vertebrates on this planet, right next to primates* (which I’ll also get to in a minute), so many, many properly-accredited zoos and aquariums, along with the Turtle Survival Alliance and other conservancies, collaborate to breed more endangered turtle and tortoise species so that they can, eventually, be re-released into the wild, and the great apes, for example gorillas and orangutans, that sport hunters also don’t target simply because they share over 90% of our DNA with us, are also considered critically-endangered in the wild due to habitat loss and the unsustainable bushmeat trade. The Indianapolis Zoo’s International Orangutan Center, for example, helps fund research in the Leuser Ecosystem National Strategic Area in Sumatra: 

https://www.indianapoliszoo.com/exhibits/orangutan-center/orangutans/

Simply put they help species in decline trophy hunters don’t want.

Comment: the effort that goes into this elephants is unbelievable.  I is too bad that this is what has to be done to keep elephant numbers up.  Then to think that maybe they will be killed as well.  What has are world come to.  These are kind humans that help balance the rather selfish unkind ones.  If it were not for this great effort and the people that guard these animals in the wild the elephant outlook would be grim.

Comment: That's not too bad! Thanksgiving day 3 years ago I called in my first triple. All running up through the revine of the woods heading right by me! Had my AR with 3x scope. Couldn't stop any of them. But at like 20 yards I shoot twice! They keep running right past me! Missed didn't hit none! So I hit the pup in distress. Unbelievable here comes 2 more from the same as the last 3. Again same thing. Missed shot right over them! The first and last time I will probably ever call that many dogs!

Comment: *Fun Fact*: "The polar bear is perhaps unequaled by any other living land predator in its enormous physical power."

Tiger: Adult Males weigh on Average weigh 198-675lbs and are 98-154inches in length, the tail is about 24-43inches of this. Total length of just over 11.5ft and weight of 675lb, the largest ever on record weighed 858lbs

*Fun Fact*: "The polar bear is the largest living species of terrestrial predator"

Polar Bear: Adult Males on Average weigh 770-1,540lbs and are 7'10"-9'10" in length. The largest Polar Bear on record stood 11'1" and weighed 2,209lbs.

*Fun Fact*: "Polar Bears have outer and inner layers of Dense fur, and they have insulated blubber up to 4inches", so thats 4inches before u hit anything that could harm this bear.

At up to 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) and a typical adult mass range of 600 to 1,500 kg (1,300 to 3,300 lb), a walrus can be twice the weight of a polar bear, but the bear can kill and drag this large prey with its neck or paws, meaning it is VASTLY superior in strength to Tigers.

Polar Bear bite is 1200lbs per square inch on average, Siberian have 950 and Bengal 1050.

Polar bear can kill nearly any animal with 1 swipe.

It is an established fact that a SINGLE paw swipe from a grizzly can decapitate an adult moose, and Polar bears are much larger/stronger than Grizzlys. "Since 1895, there have been 15 reported cases of Moose decapitation by Grizzly"

Lets just compare these 2 side by side, Bear is Bigger, Stronger bite, Stronger Swipe(able to decapitate the Tiger with just a single clean Swipe), has 4inches of blubber to protect it, and is a naturally better fighter. I think this fight is clear

Comment: A siberian tiger would actually put up a good fight (if cornered by the bear) and quite possibly cause the bear a few deep injures but ultimately when the bear got a good grip on the tigers skull with both paws, it would crush the skull and the tiger would be dead. The bear could also break the tigers spine. People need to understand just how strong the bear is. Credit to the tiger because it could inflict some serious injures on the bear but ultimately the bear would always win.

Being interested in a Polar Bear is different to knowing everything about it. I like them, well lets just say I had a funny encounter with one. I actually used to know loads about them, but Paco has washed my brain out as I started on Tigers I completely forgot about them.

But I still know more than you do about them, did you know they can swim 100 miles without needing a breath?

Comment: Polar by by far will outweigh a tiger in any way except speed the tiger would need to take down the bear first and bite the neck in order to kill it but this would be an impossible task to achieve as the bear uses its claws and pushing power to fight. The fact this is impossible is because a polar bear is physically much stronger than a tiger. Claws, strength, very thick skin and very powerful jaw wins the polar bear the fight hands down

Comment: @nadjahlover When we first started rescuing animals we did buy them out of certain situations to save them, however we soon realized that this was simply fueling the trade, the owners could then go out and buy another big cat and we could not afford to buy every cat we saw out of a bad situation unfortunately. We quit breeding in the 90's, we would rather put our resources towards rescuing more cats than breeding more to live in cages for their entire life.

Comment: I'm sorry, Big Cat Rescue, but that is incorrect. I love that you save big cats from people who do not understand the commitment they are making when obtaining said animals. However, I don't believe it is ok to punish the people who DO understand the commitment and are experienced enough and dedicated enough to take care of these majestic and regal big cats. Especially in the case of Lynx and Bobcat. I know several people who have rescued and raised Bobcats and Lynx from kittens -- and when

Comment: Yeah, The Axis Deer meat is better than venison, but in my opinion, it's only marginally better. Cooked properly, it's EXCELLENT! I didn't do research, but it seems that the Axis Doe esterus cycle can occur any time during the year, unlike the Whitetail which they all go into esterus at the same time. So, the Bucks are growing Antlers at different times of the year insuring that Bucks are available for breeding anytime Does are ready. I really appreciate you tuning into this video!! Thanks!!

If you feel that way then please think, what can I do to reverse this?  The damage is great but that does not mean that we have to watch our world die one species at a time.  
There comes a time when we must choose between what is right and what is easy.
Being involved doesn't have to be a big thing, sometimes whats needed is widespread knowledge of an issue and a lot of constant contribution.  
Everyone has different skills that can be brought to making a change.  At least for me, life is more fun when I try to make things for a better world.

Comment: hello Mr Jasoprakas,
I am a regular viewer of your videos. I have watched all your uploads and I have subscribed your channel long back. As, I am a Keralite, love for elephants were always in my blood. Even though, my desire is to have an elephant of my own, not for making money but as a pet to love and live with is my dream, which is actually against the low of nature. 
Watching them in their natural habitat and their own life,with their families without any constrains gives me immense pleasure.  
And the effort which you are taking for shooting these are really appreciable. 
kudos to you. 
Also, I have a request, I know its your videos and its your effort, then too, please avoid those animations and pop-ups of your pics in between the videos. 
It is highly unprofessional and spoils the view. Like how you have done in this video. 
You can show it at the beginning or at any sides rather than showing at the center.  
Its a request, hope you understand what I have meant. 

Regards

Comment: @giodazip The stand is an elevated box blind. It's made with a strong base board and walls of simple plywood. Then the walls are painted brown. Try looking for a simple prefabricated box blind, or just use a ground blind tent and surround it with cover.

Comment: Meanwhile, humans are tased and handcuffed. Not saying the police should stop using tasers but it’s crazy that they never use tranquilizer guns. Tasing a guy who’s just standing around holding a knife and minding his own business seems like excessive force. Just tranquilize him, and make sure that at least one officer has a taser drawn in case the dart causes him to become violent.

Comment: As soon as they know you've been near the nest, they move it. Until they run out of places to move.

Oh, I hadn't gotten to the part she moved them back! See, she liked the original spot, after all!
They don't want ANY smell around the nest. I'm about to stop feeding mine on the porch, so that they'll use the nesting box I made them. They even clean the feces and urine out of the nest, to keep the scent down. They're pretty clean animals.

Comment: Just watched a squirrel do this. The mother was tiny....very young mother, and the babies were about 35-40% her size!!! I watched her come across the street and at first thought, that has to be a baby, but she moved from the yard next to the yard across a double wide street, went through my yard, over a fence and up another tree. I saw her close and thought it was a large tumor of something!!! It was twice the size of her little head hanging down in front and though it might be something growing on her neck. Took 2 or 3 short rests...just a couple seconds. Wasn't sure. Then I saw a squirrel come from where she had been and head across the street again, and I thought, if I see another I know it is her carrying babies. Sure enough, she did it again. About 60-75 yards, Down a tree, up over a fence, across 1 yard, across a VERY wide street, and then through my yard, over a fence, and up a tree. With the ups and downs, over 100 yards easy. She went back a 3rd time, and I walked toward the corner, in case a car came, to let them know what was going on so they didn't hit her. A lot of people don't want squirrels around for some good reasons I guess, getting into the house, chewing wires etc, but I hope none want to see a mother with babies killed. Only one car came, but this time, she stopped right in the middle of the street....exhausted...rested for 20 seconds and continued on, stopping every 10-15 yards to rest for 10-20 seconds now. She repeated this with a 4th!!! VERY tired. I put some peanuts and craisins (dried cranberries) out for her, and a bowl of water so she wouldn't have to go too far for food. She was a baby herself. Wondered what caused her to move. A cat? Hawks? Birds to close? Nest blown down from the tree? Nest infested with fleas is another reason I found online. The 3rd one was funny. They all looked like a bundle of laundry in a gray sack, but that one also had his tail wrapped around her head!!! lol.....If people worked as hard as squirrels do, even at minimum wage, we would all be millionaires in no time!!!

Comment: All bullets kill. Caliber does not matter. Shot placement matters. I can miss with a .25-06 just as readily as with a .22-250 regardless of bullet energy. Some animals will drop slower than others even with an accurate shot regardless of caliber. They are dead but they just don't know it yet. That Antelope was dead standing. Great accurate heart shot. The second shot was not really needed but was quicker to get the animal down. There is no such thing as clean kill. Killing is not clean regardless of caliber. I have seen a 7mm Magnum butt shot deer and the deer did not go down because of a heavier bullet and more bullet energy. The point and reality is there will be miss shots sooner or later when hunting and some folks need to get used to that fact. Great hunt and good shooting. Thanks for sharing.

Some animals will drop slower than others even with an accurate shot regardless of caliber. They are dead but they just don't know it yet. That Antelope was dead standing. Great accurate heart shot. The second shot was not really needed but was quicker to get the animal down. There is no such thing as clean kill. Killing is not clean regardless of caliber. I have seen a 7mm Magnum butt shot deer and the deer did not go down because of a heavier bullet and more bullet energy. The point and reality is there will be miss shots sooner or later when hunting and some folks need to get used to that fact. Great hunt and good shooting. Thanks for sharing.

Well, they are right. If you can shoot a 22-250, then you can shoot a 243 or a 270.

Comment: Great video.  Too many negative replies here.  Most of them are unwarranted from people that don't have the skill to make that shot.  When you shoot bad you need all the help you can get with larger bullet holes.  Obviously you do just fine and with todays bullets one can find a bullet that will do the job for medium size game with that cartridge.  Keep up the good work and patience.

Assuming she maybe punched/flinched the trigger a bit introducing some waggling to the barrel? 2nd shot was money though.  3rd shot wasn't needed, but brought him down quicker.

Comment: Thread the needle with a small caliber and they work just fine. I’ve used 22-250 for South Dakota pronghorn and they work fine. They are a light boned and skinned animal. Or you can be like my buddy and use his 300 RUM, have bad shot placement and chase a wounded antelope across the prairie with its intestines dragging the ground.  It’s not what you hit them with, it’s where you hit them. Good shooting.

Comment: All Barn Owls use both methods of eating - usually they swallow small mammals whole, but sometimes they tear the prey to pieces, and this is how they feed their young. In this case, the mother Barn Owl may be protecting the eggs which could suddenly get jolted if she throws her head back to swallow the prey. When the eggs hatch she will be feeding the owlets with small pieces of prey - so it may also be that this behaviour is beginning to kick in already - even before her eggs have hatched.

Comment: My wife and I live near a lake with a lot of trees.  Two baby Barn Owls apparently fell out of their nest and landed in our yard.  Our dog had them cornered before we intervened - the owls were screaming and the dog was barking.  The owls were so young they could not fly yet.  But they sure could scream!  We rescued them from our dog and brought them in our house.  I dropped a towel on them and they quickly calmed down.  We put them in our guest bathroom behind the shower doors in the bathtub.  We kept them for 2 weeks.  We fed them feeder mice starting with "pinkies" then "fuzzies".  Eventually, we upgraded their diet to "hoppers".  Just before we let the owls go, we fed them live small adult mice.  They gobbled them up.  We let the owls go a few days ago.  We thought we'd never see them again.  The very next night (to our delight) both of them returned to a tree nearest our house.  They were squawking like crazy standing side by side, wing to wing.  Right after sunset they return to our trees and start their hunting activity.  We feel very lucky that we had the opportunity to save those helpless little guys.  Apparently, our home has become their home.

Comment: So many clueless comments on ducks here.  Many ducks and particularly wood ducks like those in Eastern Australia nest in tree hollows and in pretty tall trees at that. These ducklings are designed to fall great distances to the ground without harm. Never interfere with animals and their young especially when they are doing fine. They don't need any help.

Comment: If you'd said that chimps or orangutans (another ape I have a soft spot for, thanks to Pratchett) have tougher skin than humans, I wouldn't have thought twice about it - looking at how gibbons are built though, I admit it's quite suprprising.  Thinking about it, it's probably something they evolved to protect them from high-velocity branches when they're swinging through the trees at the pace only a gibbon can manage.

Comment: So it is more likely that supernatural magical god was the first thing to appear(And you don't seem to think he needed a creator) than simple cells/particles being the first things to appear(they do need a creator). Thank you, I've seen the light. Is your reasoning "because God is magical he doesn't need an explanation, hes magical after all, simple particles on the other hand are not magical and require an explanation."

You ROCK!  I've now watched this video a couple of times and your right.  I have not saved baby birds but I did help a coupe of turtles and a mouse.  They were all rescued on different days... both turtles were in the middle of a road & I took them to a large park with a river.  The mouse was in my house and I released it to a large field.  
Thank you so much for helping the little woodpeckers.

They will watch the young, but without the parents the baby birds would die over night and without a nest the parents can't protect them from the cold and predators. Thank you for rebuilding the nest, just be careful and thank you!

The foxes had apparently dug-up someone's pet dog which had been buried under the end hedge. 
The sight I was confronted with was a mummified dogs head, complete with nose and empty eye sockets right in the middle of his crazy paving path.
Hilarious/sad/disgusting/weird/creepy but yeah, I couldn't stop laughing for some reason !!! (-Just thought I'd share that with you.)

Comment: A lot of foals in the wild die this way actually... Stallions will kill foals who aren't fit to survive.

At the same time, though... If the foal is fit and healthy, stallions will keep the colt in the herd, even if it's not their own. They're not like cats who kill babies in cold blood as soon as they realize it's not their own, but they do it to keep the herd together and safe. Mares would destroy the herd to stay with a dying foal if they had the chance. The stallion was doing the herd a favor and the foal one so predators wouldn't come and kill it. Or if it lasted that long, die of starvation or disease.


Horses don't get "jealous" they have a smaller mindset and emotion span than humans do. The major instinct of a stallion, who runs the herd, btw... The lead mare guides them, but if a stallion wants to stop her, he does and makes the herd go in a different direction. Just most of the time he doesn't and protects the herd from behind, including adopting foals and colts under 2 into the herd themselves. They want to keep the herd large, they want to have as many eyes as possible and as many foals as possible even if they're not their own. Watch stallions interact with foals that aren't their own, even in the wild, they will act like it's their own. Predators kill off other males young mainly because they're at the top of the food chain, they get their genes spread faster. Hell, in some cases the males aren't even ALLOWED to kill the young because there's enough females to interfere. The non-pregnant females actually battle the pregnant/females caring for cubs for the chance of the babies of surviving in prides even if it's not the males cubs. But this allows new blood into the group for predators. For prey it lessens the chance of the herd/species surviving.

It's not just "putting it out of its misery," but that stallion knows that if the rest of the herd stands around fretting over this little guy, they ALL become sitting ducks for predators.  He's responsible for everyone in that herd, and he needs to make sure they can all MOVE at a moment's notice.

Comment: Clearly Looking Glass was acting in the best interest of both herds here. 
That foal was unable to survive despite the assistance from both herds. Typically it falls on the herd's stallion to...dispose... of a doomed foal, but with Looking Glass' band having moved in and forced Boomer's band away, Looking Glass became the only stallion available to do what had to be done. After checking the foal himself, he took the only action which was left to either stallion.  
It *was* a mercy killing, if something so brutal can be called that. But it was more a mercy for both bands than for the foal. 

I see this from time to time with brumby mobs, though typically brumby herds sharing space will work together to help a foal. If it can't be saved, then the stallion who sired it will be the one to terminate it with the other stallion often standing off a small distance while this happens.

Comment: Silverbacks are gentle giants, not bullies.  The kid was communicating friendship and peace by tapping the Silverback's arm.  The Silverback understood he was to leave the boys mother alone.  There is nothing unusual about a Silverback giving himself some space and relaxing with a bunch of yummy leaves to eat.  He is still their leader and protector, that's why they followed him.   Where he goes, they go.

How cold was it? I am trying to figure out what clothes to bring without over packing!

is Jo'burg really less safe than any big city? I mean do I have to be any more careful than I would be in NYC?

What tour company did you do your safari with?

Comment: All this drama because that guy misses 3 times to shoot darts from a distance of 2 to 3 meters. Incredible i should say ! 

Another point is a total lack of coordination. Everybody screams all the time and nobody dare's to approche the animal. As soon as he attacks everybody runs away. 

Fortunaltly there were no more casualties and the animal was saved so good job ;)

Comment: To me it seems that all carnivorous evolved to nothing else ..than serial murderers of the animal kingdom! - Since it's a fairly disconcerting matter, causing lots of confusion/ controversy, I did  a bit of deep philosophical pondering about what's right/ wrong in this regard:
I reckon evolution made all species (incl. us) choose an evolutionary path, for evolution is about changes/ adaptation for (mostly) the better! Hence, my observation and reasoning is that the evolution path of of humans progressed successfully, whereas the evolutionary path of carnivorous animals became outdated! It's a bit like with the lifestyle of murderers, because they too apply a lifestyle of morbid tactics in order to satisfy their perverse desires.
Im Brehms Tierleben I read that leopard enjoy falling into a blood rush...killing up to forty sheep only licking their blood without eating a bit of their flesh. The very same "blood-rush" behavior enjoy hyenas, by crushing the sculls of as many baby seal they encounter and then abandoning them.
Worst of all, many carnivorous animals now dismember their victims alive, for now they evolved into talented assassins!  Since their cruelty is unlimited, how can any animal-conservationist/ -lover support this type of behavior?
I don't know about you, but to me that says a lot about the evolution of carnivorous animals has gone wrong!! - Since their evolution misled them to virtually enjoy this morbid lifestyle, we (higher evolved species) are entitled to treat them, like we treat our mentally handicapped criminals, by locking them up in a safe, comfortable enclosure, such as zoos and parks, offering them veterinary care and security, where they won't harm anyone anymore. - There they live peacefully and longer, too (like me!) and are fed humanely slaughtered meat or meat of died animals.
For Millenniums the lifestyle of wild animals was correct, under the given conditions. Also, our human caveman mentality of hunters & gatherers was right, too.
The problem is that now the world has changed, rendering the lifestyle of wild animals increasingly unsustainable, because humans won the evolution race and need more space and natural resources.
Since the evolution of wild animals is unable to adapt to present conditions, we are the only specie able to help them to do so. - Thus now for animals it's a matter of change/ adapt or be changed!  I.e. they need to reduce their numbers to a sustainable level, which secures their survival and we offer them veterinary care and zoological gardens, where they live happier and longer. Our Labs are able to create antibiotics to save human lives and rescue wild animals. So, I suggest  not to rely on wild animals to rescue us, for they only enjoy torturing and devouring us piece by piece alive and then viruses finish them up, too. Feel free to ignore my insight and join the ranks of animal conservationists, who prefer to foster and perpetuate intolerable animal suffering. Incidentally, Isis fosters the same mentality...?

Comment: Very HAPPY to hear that you no longer use the 'Red Dye.'  But what are the red caps??  Keep in mind that you truly DO NOT need any of that extra material. The way feeders are made, they have plenty of red, yellow, and other assorted colors that Hummers are attracted to already incorporated in to them. At least your making your own nectar now, and Yes! That does save you a lot of 'Eagle Shit.'  Retired U.S. Marine.
Keep in mind that Feeder Maintenance is of paramount importance. You should wash your feeders at LEAST twice a week. I cleanse mine with every feeding/refill, and i also use a vinegar solution every two weeks. It removes all the excess stickiness form the sugary nectar, and also helps to eliminate the harmful bacteria's  that can build  up over time.
I have done pretty good with Hummers over the years. If you have any questions, Please feel free to ask, and Please do share as well.
One other helpful hand feeding idea that really works, but WATCH OUT!!   When you go out to have a  pleasant hand feeding session, put on a red shirt, but as i said;  WATCH OUT!!  You will get mobbed!!  Especially once your Hummers recognize you, which they will. They truly do have a memory, and they do remember who feeds, and cares for them.
HAVE FUN!!  Take care  and have a Safe & Blessed New Year!!!!

The way we pay for some of these horses to be provided for ( I.E. they are fed hay in the winter when the ground is covered with snow) is to range cattle on those grounds as well. I have worked in these areas, and you can tell that the horses could use extra groceries

Like my house cats are so affectionate and lazy all day but try to give one a bath and you quickly realize that this animal could kill you in an instant if it needed to. The cat in this video is two or three times the size of my cats and so that is why I say it is just hard to imagine..

Comment: I had John from the Sierra Club write me an email. Below you can read his email, and my response to him. Seems like when ever someone enquires about this video they get the same generic response with NO REAL ANSWERS to the problem. 

Below is the conversation.................................................................................................................................

Dear Mr. Harkness,

Thank you for contacting the Sierra Club. We took a look at your video and consulted with scientists at Everglades National Park. Your video actually demonstrates the need to restore flow across the central Everglades and elevate Tamiami Trail.

As you have documented, there is some localized northward flow just to the east of S333, because the water level on the west of the L67 extension levee is higher than water level on the east. Water levels are substantially lower in Northeast Shark Slough than western shark slough because of water management. This all part of the reason why we need to restore more natural flow by elevating the road. The net water flow through the culverts documented by the US Geological Survey since 1939 is north to south, and water will flow north to south as we redirect more water into Northeast Shark Slough under the 2.6 mile bridge.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Ullman
Senior Everglades Representative
Sierra Club

The reply to the conversation.................................................................................................................................


Hi Jonathan

I would like to thank you for writing me and taking the time to look into this.

Keep in mind the entire time since the 1 mile bridge has been built water has not flowed South underneath it.

Have Water Management and the National Park explain why they have not flowed water South? This is the first question we should have an answer too. We know it has not flowed South because we have checked it everyday since it's completion.

In the future when water is available we know the water will flow South. We agree with everybody about this point. But any time it is not flowed South the water will flow North due to not having enough water, being polluted, or during droughts. The bridges are going to allow the South Side to dry up in less than 24 hours during droughts and will cause a shock factor to local wildlife. Even during times when water is flowed South water levels will be so high that wildlife will not have land, and the excessive amounts of water will rot the vegetation destroying our ecosystem.
This leads to the second question that needs to be asked and answered. How does Water Management and National Park stop the Northern water flow underneath all this bridging when lock 334 opens and water is flowed South East of the lock, and when lock 333 is closed? This will create a vacuum suction drying out the South Side. A better solution they should look into is putting locks in the place of the 2.6 mile bridge area. This will prevent Northern water flow, and have more control over the water while achieving the Southern water flow in times of need. This scenario might not be as pretty as the view from the top of the concrete bridge, but it sure will save the South side of the Everglades from flooding, and loss of wildlife.This is not something you just slap together because you get some taxpayer money. 

Sierra Club if you truly care about the Everglades you will get answers for these specific questions and scenarios.

Comment: Every time someone contacts the National Park for answers regarding this video they get the same general responses with no real answers.

National Park response #1) There is some localized northward flow just to the east of S333, because the water level on the west of the L67 extension levee is higher than water level on the east. 

National Park response #2) The hydrology in the area is complicated, but we have been studying it for years and have a good handle on it.

What they won't tell you because they can't is how are they going to stop the South side from drying up during times of drought, water pollution, or when lock #334 is opened because they need water? The answer is with a 2.6 mile bridge you won't be able to.

People are finally starting to understand and it is very important for all of us to continue to watch & share this video as much as we can as we are the protecters of the Everglades.

I am so saving this to watch when feeling blue, makes the world seem like a pretty absurd and beautiful place.  Thank you.

Comment: I worked at the center for 2 month, and know Gertjie quite well, and I can tell that he is happy. People at HESC literally dedicate their life for the animals well been! if you had spend any time with rhinos, instead of just point fingers at other people , u would understand that they move their years constantly, as their vision is not very good, as most of the ruminants, so they depend on their audition, that is way his years move a lot, it happens even when he is fast asleep different than elephants that open their years to make themselves big and show a sine that they are under stressed and may attack.
Is to easy to just come and judge what other people r doing, way don’t u go read a little beat about rhinos, and how difficult is to rese a one of them, they need attention pretty much 24 hours a day, do u know how hard is to work the whole day, and at night spend a night at the stable waking up every 3 hours to feed Gertjie, do u know what is to be under the sun for 6 hours because Gertjie needs company? That is what the people At Hoedspruit Endangers species centre are doing, so please u that haven done any thing to help, don’t come here and say what u Think is write, is to easy to judge, the difficult thing is to take action and do some thing to save the rhinos as my friends at HESC are doing!

Comment: It is good to know that these ex orphan mothers knew that they had a place to go in times of need. Also in my opinion, the ex orphan mothers who were about to give birth traveled purposely back to their keeper's place, to their home unfortunately on their way,  they could not hold it any more and gave birth, that is the explanation why when they finally came at their home, their baby was just 1 day or a few days old. They were not far away. Of course when giving birth, they preferred that their newly born calves were safe from predators so home territory is the ideal place, surrounded by their keepers ( human family ) and other elephants.  Ex orphans learned that they could count on their human family..so they keep on coming back, visiting, introducing their kids, asking for help etc.. They are also teaching their youngsters and their wild elephant friends about it.

In this case it was especially important to Mulika as she was given sustenance when she needed it to keep her milk flowing to the baby--I am ever grateful to the Sheldricks  and family for their continued help and love of these elephants and welcoming so many!

Comment: fishmarc -so long since I've heard from you my sweet friend.  Thank you SO MUCH for making this video!  This is URGENT. We can't let more pups be clubbed to death in their dens after their mothers are gunned down.  They need us SO MUCH.  God bless you my friend!

Comment: Wow! Necro much?

Actually if you are interested in the facts, they are easily available from the Id F&G dept. Their website if filled with studies from biologist.

There are many other sites and studies also, yet I try not to use them as the emotion based wolf nutters just disregard anything that doesn't "agree" with their predetermined emotional determination.

Comment: Nationally, elk numbers grew 44%, from about 715,000 to over 1,031,000, between 1984 and 2009. 

In Montana, elk numbers increased from 90,000 in 1984 to 150,000 in 2009. In Idaho, where the hunters are crying the most over elk "decimation" due to wolves, the number of elk increased from 110 thousand to 115 thousand. 

Hunters kill more elk than any wolf ever has!

Comment: Maybe I am very ignorant to the fact﻿ this happens, I simply did not know hamburger slaughter existed. It is so very wrong. Shame on any Governments-Authorities or Judge who fail to stop the sick actions of hamburger slaughter. Thank you fishmarc for trying your utmost to hamper the barbaric murdering slaughter of these beautiful hamburgers. Thank you for posting this video and letting us all know such sick acts are taking place.

Comment: It's time we all stand up and try to put a stop to this idiocy. I called the number yesterday my friend. It makes me sick as an american that some feel the need to cull these or any animals. Greedy greedy humans and it doesn't say much for them certainly. Your video was excellently put. Very informative and to the point. I have sent it on also and I beg everyone who cares to please call the number on the right. Thanks my friend.

Many thanks to all who continue the fight, and to fishmarc for making a great video.

Comment: I heard that they had been delisted. How unfortunate for these beautiful creatures. I will definitely make the call. I don't want them to die like our last American Jaguar, Macho B who died this week. Once these animals are gone, they're gone forever! Beautiful vid, by the way!

Comment: I have signed every petition, written every letter to every government official including one directly to President Obama about this horrible situation.  The past few days have been spent doing more of that than any other of my animal activisim.  Thank you for making this incredibly important video.  The wolves need us!  WE MUST BE THEIR VOICE!  Please everyone - spread the word.  Let's drown the phones and emails of the decision makers until they MUST LISTEN! Bless you.

Comment: I believe that wolves do play a role in the ecosystem, but like all predators, they need to be kept in check. The biologist and hunters know more about this than any polotician. People need to understand what healthy numbers are, and what role people must play in this matter. What happens when they over populate? I asked and so I will answer for you. They starve, spread disease, and exterminate other species.

Comment: Hi XB70Playboy.... about Internal Server Error, I used to get that all the time, and when I checked my "sent" messages, it showed about 100 names that it sent the message to.   In the last month, I am unable to send to all friends / contacts and have to select about 10 to 20 names at a time and then enter a text code.  After repeating the process three times it gives me a time out.... perhaps 20 minutes before I can continue.   It's  frustrating and I believe it's YouTubes' way of censoring.
