Walking around you can gaze upon some of the more amazing animals from around the world. From some of the largest to the downright deadly. Zoos offer the average Joe, and his family, a glimpse into the wonders of the natural world. The zoo can trace its origins back to a more family unfriendly time, to ancient Egypt, when for the pharaoh, owning a hippo zoo was completely normal. It was only into the 19th century when the roaring industrial masses wanted a piece of the action, and science was taking off that the modern zoo was born. And sure, zoos have received bad press in the past, but the modern zoo has been reinvented as a centre of science and conservation. So what are the roles of a modern zoo? Well, roughly speaking, we can divide them into three categories, education, breeding centres, and research. So let's start with education. It's simple really, zoos are a fun and safe place to learn for both kids and adults. The fact is, the animals are real, and you can get up and close to some of the more exotic and threatened creatures from around the world. Every year, 150 million people visit zoos around the world, and it's so important that the next generation is educated and understands the role they play in preserving our planet. Better still, many zoos have education centres with dedicated teams who aim to teach kids about everything from ecosystem services to climate change. Zoos also play an important role as breeding centres. Most zoos these days are part of organisations set up to coordinate breeding programmes and keep standards high. This means your favourite animal like the chimpanzee here is probably part of some national or even international breeding programme. These help zoos maintain genetic diversity and are extremely important for species that are threatened with extinction in the wild. One example is the scimitar-horned oryx. This is a species that became extinct in the wild and only survived in zoos and private collections. It is now part of several international breeding programmes and the hope is one day it will be reintroduced into the wild. And finally, Zoos offer a unique opportunity for biologists. Instead of spending days trying to track down an animal and becoming exhausted in the process, zoos offer a more controlled environment where effective research can be undertaken. Take the devastating disease chytridiomycosis. This has caused dramatic declines and even extinction in at least 200 species of frog. Zoos are actively taking part in research aiming to stop the spread of this disease. Research in zoos contribute to a number of scientific fields including animal behaviour and endocrinology, all ultimately contributing to the conservation of our biodiversity. So sure, a trip to the zoo is a great family day out, but zoos these days aren't there to show off your new hippo. Zoos are centres for conservation, educating the new generation, giving critically endangered species another chance and helping us gather knowledge for the conservation of species and biodiversity.

These help zoos maintain genetic diversity and are extremely important for species that are threatened with extinction in the wild. One example is the scimitar-horned oryx. This is a species that became extinct in the wild and only survived in zoos and private collections. It is now part of several international breeding programmes and the hope is one day it will be reintroduced into the wild. And finally, Zoos offer a unique opportunity for biologists. Instead of spending days trying to track down an animal and becoming exhausted in the process, zoos offer a more controlled environment where effective research can be undertaken. Take the devastating disease chytridiomycosis. This has caused dramatic declines and even extinction in at least 200 species of frog. Zoos are actively taking part in research aiming to stop the spread of this disease. Research in zoos contribute to a number of scientific fields including animal behaviour and endocrinology, all ultimately contributing to the conservation of our biodiversity. So sure, a trip to the zoo is a great family day out, but zoos these days aren't there to show off your new hippo. Zoos are centres for conservation, educating the new generation, giving critically endangered species another chance and helping us gather knowledge for the conservation of species and biodiversity.

SUBSCRIBE ►  zoo has come a long way, transforming from a place of public entertainment, to the modern zoo, which many see as a centre for conservation. So why do we even need modern zoos?

Walking around you can gaze upon some of the more amazing animals from around the world. From some of the largest to the downright deadly. Zoos offer the average Joe, and his family, a glimpse into the wonders of the natural world. The zoo can trace its origins back to a more family unfriendly time, to ancient Egypt, when for the pharaoh, owning a hippo zoo was completely normal. It was only into the 19th century when the roaring industrial masses wanted a piece of the action, and science was taking off that the modern zoo was born. And sure, zoos have received bad press in the past, but the modern zoo has been reinvented as a centre of science and conservation. So what are the roles of a modern zoo? Well, roughly speaking, we can divide them into three categories, education, breeding centres, and research. So let's start with education. It's simple really, zoos are a fun and safe place to learn for both kids and adults. The fact is, the animals are real, and you can get up and close to some of the more exotic and threatened creatures from around the world. Every year, 150 million people visit zoos around the world, and it's so important that the next generation is educated and understands the role they play in preserving our planet. Better still, many zoos have education centres with dedicated teams who aim to teach kids about everything from ecosystem services to climate change. Zoos also play an important role as breeding centres. Most zoos these days are part of organisations set up to coordinate breeding programmes and keep standards high. This means your favourite animal like the chimpanzee here is probably part of some national or even international breeding programme. These help zoos maintain genetic diversity and are extremely important for species that are threatened with extinction in the wild. One example is the scimitar-horned oryx. This is a species that became extinct in the wild and only survived in zoos and private collections.

They suspect that poachers killed their mother for her pelt. At first, everyone thinks they're leopard cubs. It turns out they're the rarest of finds. Two clouded leopard cubs. The find captures the imagination of top Indian wildlife photographer Sandesh Kadur. Cats have always fascinated me, and when I heard about these clouded leopards being rehabilitated back into the wild, I dropped everything and rushed to the spot to document the whole process. In terms of filming a new species of cat, I mean, this was it. This is the holy grail. Clouded leopards are amazing creatures, the smallest of the big cats. Shy and elusive, even cat specialists know little about their habits in the wild. Just keeping them alive is a big challenge. A leading vet, Dr. Bhaskar Chowdhury, takes charge of caring for these very special cubs. That was the first experience for me to see wild clouded leopard cubs for the first time in my life. So I was really excited and also a bit nervous because the onus is on us, the veterinarians, to make them survive. Bhaskar is determined that the cubs don't end up in the zoo like most orphaned big cats. He gets permission to try something totally unprecedented, to teach clouded leopard cubs how to be wild. It's totally new, never been tried, never been tested, and people, you know, many scientists won't believe this. It's a huge gamble. If his new protocol succeeds, it will boost dwindling numbers of clouded leopards in their real home, the forest. If they get it wrong, the cubs will die.\nComment: 1:00 omg i just died of cuteness <3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

They suspect that poachers killed their mother for her pelt. At first, everyone thinks they're leopard cubs. It turns out they're the rarest of finds. Two clouded leopard cubs. The find captures the imagination of top Indian wildlife photographer Sandesh Kadur. Cats have always fascinated me, and when I heard about these clouded leopards being rehabilitated back into the wild, I dropped everything and rushed to the spot to document the whole process. In terms of filming a new species of cat, I mean, this was it. This is the holy grail. Clouded leopards are amazing creatures, the smallest of the big cats. Shy and elusive, even cat specialists know little about their habits in the wild. Just keeping them alive is a big challenge. A leading vet, Dr. Bhaskar Chowdhury, takes charge of caring for these very special cubs. That was the first experience for me to see wild clouded leopard cubs for the first time in my life. So I was really excited and also a bit nervous because the onus is on us, the veterinarians, to make them survive. Bhaskar is determined that the cubs don't end up in the zoo like most orphaned big cats. He gets permission to try something totally unprecedented, to teach clouded leopard cubs how to be wild. It's totally new, never been tried, never been tested, and people, you know, many scientists won't believe this. It's a huge gamble. If his new protocol succeeds, it will boost dwindling numbers of clouded leopards in their real home, the forest.

The park is definitely worth a visit, but watch the video first to get a little preview and see how Suzanne gets friendly with a couple of cheetahs!\nTranscript: Today I'm at Alhoreen Wildlife Park in Sakhir. I can already hear the birds in the background and I hear they've got a few of these babies as well. So I'm excited. Let's go check it out. The Wildlife Sanctuary was built in 1975 to protect rare Arabian species such as the Oryx, Adex and Reem gazelle. Now the park has over 1,000 species of animals including exotic birds, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas and even a few giraffes. Visitors to the park pay about 1 dinar for a tour and overview of the facilities. The tour includes a short video of the wildlife in the area and a bus ride through the reserve. So we're at the carnivorous complex now. Could you tell us about the animals that live here? We have here the Arabian leopard. This Arabian leopard is a very dangerous species and we have also the Arabian wolf. He is endangered and the caracal is a very endangered species and cheetah also. We're going into the cheetah cage right now. I'm just a little bit nervous. Oh, more birds. Don't, don't tease me. Don't tease me. Don't tease me. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. I want to touch it now. Okay, you touch, no problem. It is okay, I know. Oh, look at me, look at me. Look at me. Catering to visitors and residents alike, the Al Horeen Wildlife Park is a must-see experience for the animal enthusiasts. The park is perfect for families and animal lovers to explore at leisure.

I can already hear the birds in the background and I hear they've got a few of these babies as well. So I'm excited. Let's go check it out. The Wildlife Sanctuary was built in 1975 to protect rare Arabian species such as the Oryx, Adex and Reem gazelle. Now the park has over 1,000 species of animals including exotic birds, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas and even a few giraffes. Visitors to the park pay about 1 dinar for a tour and overview of the facilities. The tour includes a short video of the wildlife in the area and a bus ride through the reserve. So we're at the carnivorous complex now. Could you tell us about the animals that live here? We have here the Arabian leopard. This Arabian leopard is a very dangerous species and we have also the Arabian wolf. He is endangered and the caracal is a very endangered species and cheetah also. We're going into the cheetah cage right now. I'm just a little bit nervous. Oh, more birds. Don't, don't tease me. Don't tease me. Don't tease me. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. I want to touch it now. Okay, you touch, no problem. It is okay, I know. Oh, look at me, look at me. Look at me. Catering to visitors and residents alike, the Al Horeen Wildlife Park is a must-see experience for the animal enthusiasts. The park is perfect for families and animal lovers to explore at leisure.

Second - thanks even more for SUBSCRIBING! This was filmed on one amazing day in Three Sisters Springs, Crystal River, Florida. The music is by my good friends Human Agency ( currently blowing up the Denver music scene.This day was a dream, this trip was serendipitous...every step fell into place like clockwork.Despite manatees not being commonly seen in the area for months, the one day I show up to Crystal River so do the sea cows. I saw huge males, tiny babies, and playful teenage manatees all in Three Sisters Springs at the same time. I also interacted with the fauna of the ecosystem, including snappers, bluegills, and cormorants, who were busy hunting fish. This experience stands out as one of my favorite wildlife encounters to date. The manatees are so friendly, and genuinely seem to appreciate your company. They eagerly seek out belly-rubs and scratches in the same way my dog does. It was so much fun hanging out with them. Unfortunately, I also saw scars on the backs of nearly every manatee in the springs. The animals get hurt or killed from run-ins with boats in the Florida waterways. Only 5,000 or so of these amazing animals remain in the wild. This was filmed with GoPro Hero2 and Hero3 cameras, filmed at either 1080p or 2.7k, 30fps, using the ProTune setting. All filming and editing was done by William Drumm. Editing was in GoPro CineForm Studio and Final Cut Pro X.

Thanksgiving day 3 years ago I called in my first triple. All running up through the revine of the woods heading right by me! Had my AR with 3x scope. Couldn't stop any of them. But at like 20 yards I shoot twice! They keep running right past me! Missed didn't hit none! So I hit the pup in distress. Unbelievable here comes 2 more from the same as the last 3. Again same thing. Missed shot right over them! The first and last time I will probably ever call that many dogs! "},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Listen to Master Keeper Barbara Frank talk about Dances and Canadian Lynx in the wild.Image of Canadian Lynx in trap courtesy of:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: This is Dances with Wolves, Big Cat Rescue's resident Canadian lynx. She's also one of the oldest cats at the sanctuary. She'll be turning 19 in July. The name lynx comes from the Greek word to shine, which is probably in reference to the reflective ability of the cat's eyes. The Canadian lynx looks very similar to its cousin, the Siberian lynx. Their dense fur ranges in color from a reddish brown to gray. They have a flared facial ruff, black ear tufts, and long hind legs with a short tail. Their large, widespread feet are covered in fur, which act as snowshoes and are effective in supporting the cat's weight on the snow. They are often confused with their smaller feline cousin, the bobcat, but can be easily distinguished by their tail tips. The tail of the lynx looks as though it was dipped in an inkwell, being black all the way around, whereas the bobcat's tail appears to have been painted black on top and white on the bottom. They are larger on average than the bobcat, yet vary less in size, so the largest bobcats can outsize the lynx. Canadian lynx are found in the northern forests across almost all of Canada and Alaska, as well as in certain parts of North America. They're a secretive and mostly nocturnal animal, although they may be active at any time of the day. Unlike any other species of cat, the lynx depends almost exclusively on the snowshoe hare. No other predator has such a strong cyclic prey base to which it has become uniquely adapted. The snowshoe hare population peaks every 10 years, and with it, so does the lynx population. While lynx will change their prey base when hares are low to include rodents, birds, larger prey such as deer, the overall lynx population is still synchronous with the hare population. The greatest threat to the Canadian lynx is being trapped for their fur, and when this is done during low numbers, it makes recovery of the population extremely difficult. And of course, just like all the other wild species of cats, destruction of their habitat by humans is also a big concern. Dances with Wolves was rescued from a game farm. Game farms are places where exotic animals are bred for photography and filming. These animals are often drugged and chained in place and surrounded by props that resemble their natural habitat. These are many of the photos that you see on calendars and in commercials. To find out more, visit our website, bigcatrescue.org. You can help us change the way people treat big cats by texting the word TIGER to 20222.\nComment: @nadjahlover When we first started rescuing animals we did buy them out of certain situations to save them, however we soon realized that this was simply fueling the trade, the owners could then go out and buy another big cat and we could not afford to buy every cat we saw out of a bad situation unfortunately. We quit breeding in the 90's, we would rather put our resources towards rescuing more cats than breeding more to live in cages for their entire life."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Listen to Master Keeper Barbara Frank talk about Dances and Canadian Lynx in the wild.Image of Canadian Lynx in trap courtesy of:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: This is Dances with Wolves, Big Cat Rescue's resident Canadian lynx. She's also one of the oldest cats at the sanctuary. She'll be turning 19 in July. The name lynx comes from the Greek word to shine, which is probably in reference to the reflective ability of the cat's eyes. The Canadian lynx looks very similar to its cousin, the Siberian lynx. Their dense fur ranges in color from a reddish brown to gray. They have a flared facial ruff, black ear tufts, and long hind legs with a short tail. Their large, widespread feet are covered in fur, which act as snowshoes and are effective in supporting the cat's weight on the snow. They are often confused with their smaller feline cousin, the bobcat, but can be easily distinguished by their tail tips. The tail of the lynx looks as though it was dipped in an inkwell, being black all the way around, whereas the bobcat's tail appears to have been painted black on top and white on the bottom. They are larger on average than the bobcat, yet vary less in size, so the largest bobcats can outsize the lynx. Canadian lynx are found in the northern forests across almost all of Canada and Alaska, as well as in certain parts of North America. They're a secretive and mostly nocturnal animal, although they may be active at any time of the day. Unlike any other species of cat, the lynx depends almost exclusively on the snowshoe hare. No other predator has such a strong cyclic prey base to which it has become uniquely adapted. The snowshoe hare population peaks every 10 years, and with it, so does the lynx population. While lynx will change their prey base when hares are low to include rodents, birds, larger prey such as deer, the overall lynx population is still synchronous with the hare population. The greatest threat to the Canadian lynx is being trapped for their fur, and when this is done during low numbers, it makes recovery of the population extremely difficult. And of course, just like all the other wild species of cats, destruction of their habitat by humans is also a big concern. Dances with Wolves was rescued from a game farm. Game farms are places where exotic animals are bred for photography and filming. These animals are often drugged and chained in place and surrounded by props that resemble their natural habitat. These are many of the photos that you see on calendars and in commercials. To find out more, visit our website, bigcatrescue.org.

Hi, cutie. As the sun is out and about in Africa, so are the animals. Now look at these zeebees. They're ultra-affectionate. That's right, zebras want rubs too, you know. Look, this one's going at it with the tree. This wildebeest is like, give me a break. You zebras have a lot to learn, please. Cut the affection. It's time to live and survive. What are you, cray-cray? Come on, move it! Those lionesses are going to eat your ass! Wildebeest is Dutch for wild beast or wild cattle, and they're more or less like antelope. They're like the antelope of Africa in certain parts, and they can live up to 40 years. Amazing. Oh, look at this beauty. This is a grey-crowned crane. What a gorgeous headdress. The grey-crowned cranes are also found in Africa, and they have such a startling call. If you heard it, you would poop yourself, I'm telling you. Now look, look at these Congo peafowls. Congo peafowls, or Congo peacocks, are splendid. They have those blue heads, and they're the national bird of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And they dwell mostly by the river basin. Now look, this cheetah's like, holy shit, and I thought I was fast. Those peafowls move like lightning, says this cheetah. Across the way, over by the water, there are just so many wonderful birds of Africa. They're all just chilling. Look at this. Look at these schools of birds just flying around, doing their thing, mostly trying to get fish out of the water. And as you can see, these are great, there are some great white pelicans here. And the great white pelicans have a wingspan of 7 to 11 feet. What the fuck? That is crazy. That's like a bumming 757. Now look at these black, these are African black ducks. They're very shy, yet territorial. Now look at this pelican, getting all primpy. And these are brown peafowls, just doing a little head dance in the water, waiting for fish. African black ducks, great white pelicans, all these birds just chilling, waiting for a chance to eat. Now what's nasty about the great white pelican is that they, while they mainly eat fish, they've been known to eat chicks and smaller birds. That is so nasty. Look at those legs. I can't believe how they're able to do that with their toes.

Look how absolutely gorgeous and stunning it is. What a beautiful environment. As you may or may not know, which I'm sure you do know, Africa is home to so much wildlife. It's insane. It is so gorgeous. Look at that skyline. Oh, look at these two! Oh, hello lionesses! What are you looking for? Some scraps for your family? Oh, this lioness totally knows it's hunting time. Hi, cutie. As the sun is out and about in Africa, so are the animals. Now look at these zeebees. They're ultra-affectionate. That's right, zebras want rubs too, you know. Look, this one's going at it with the tree. This wildebeest is like, give me a break. You zebras have a lot to learn, please. Cut the affection. It's time to live and survive. What are you, cray-cray? Come on, move it! Those lionesses are going to eat your ass! Wildebeest is Dutch for wild beast or wild cattle, and they're more or less like antelope. They're like the antelope of Africa in certain parts, and they can live up to 40 years. Amazing. Oh, look at this beauty. This is a grey-crowned crane. What a gorgeous headdress. The grey-crowned cranes are also found in Africa, and they have such a startling call. If you heard it, you would poop yourself, I'm telling you. Now look, look at these Congo peafowls. Congo peafowls, or Congo peacocks, are splendid. They have those blue heads, and they're the national bird of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And they dwell mostly by the river basin. Now look, this cheetah's like, holy shit, and I thought I was fast. Those peafowls move like lightning, says this cheetah. Across the way, over by the water, there are just so many wonderful birds of Africa. They're all just chilling. Look at this. Look at these schools of birds just flying around, doing their thing, mostly trying to get fish out of the water. And as you can see, these are great, there are some great white pelicans here. And the great white pelicans have a wingspan of 7 to 11 feet. What the fuck? That is crazy. That's like a bumming 757. Now look at these black, these are African black ducks. They're very shy, yet territorial. Now look at this pelican, getting all primpy. And these are brown peafowls, just doing a little head dance in the water, waiting for fish. African black ducks, great white pelicans, all these birds just chilling, waiting for a chance to eat. Now what's nasty about the great white pelican is that they, while they mainly eat fish, they've been known to eat chicks and smaller birds. That is so nasty. Look at those legs. I can't believe how they're able to do that with their toes. The birds of Africa.\nComment: That's a fantastic question which I will personally answer on my new series, \"WWHBD?\" (What Would Honey Badger Do?). I answer questions and give honest, honey badger advice for anyone who needs it! I will totes give you mention on the show and I hope you watch for your answer!

I don't care how little it is. It could only bite your foot. Little ones don't eat? It could only lose a toe. Do you think that's real? Yeah. So did we see a crocodile or an alligator? It wasn't out. I didn't know there was a whale. It's got a strap. For photos, on the second half of the tour of that bird, they're going to be standing right next to you. Okay? I've never been in any place where you could get this close to great blue herons, and I've never seen... The wildlife in the Everglades don't play by the rules, because water is life. Whatever God gives us for that amount of water of the year, they have. Whether you're dangerous or not, we don't want to appear dangerous. This is a mother alligator. How many people are seeing an alligator in the wild for the first time today? Okay. I've got three questions for you, and we're going to have a quiz at the top. What color are alligators? I didn't ask you. You better tell me later. Oh, see, she's tired of me already. Oh, she's okay. Oh, she's big enough to be a monitor. They start off maybe four or five feet long. Yeah, the babies are on the grass behind the mothers. I think that might be a baby gator. The baby gators are on the grass behind you? Yeah. Are you a mama? Well, obviously that has to be a female. Well, if it was a male, there weren't any babies in there. They'd be in his tummy. Well, I can tell you how you wouldn't need to find out for sure if you wanted to want to. Anyway, mama and one little baby on the pipe. Oh, there's two babies. They're like right across from each other. It's like stereo babies. Stereo baby gators. Very relaxed because we've had a long, very hot, very dry rainy season. And the other years we were very stressed out. Yep, it's the babies. Two of them. All right, now let's turn it up. The babies are quiet. See? The babies are quiet. She's backing up three babies. We're just going to roll them by real slow. She's not real happy. See how protected she is? Unlike most reptiles, turtles or whatever that lay their eggs and then go back in the water. That's in a motherhood. Now a gator is more like a panther in the way the female protects her babies. And she will protect her babies not only from birds and otters or whatever is coming after them. She will have to protect her babies from turtles. Come back. Relax. We're at the tower here at Shark Island. I'm going to zoom in. Just laying on the grass there. Yeah. Is this another little one over here? Yeah. Push it. Is that another little one right here? That thing's a monster. It's crazy. Push it. Okay, we're heading to the tower at Shark Island. We just saw a whole bunch of alligators. Probably about six. And they were mothers with babies. And we're just walking to the tower right now. The tower is right there. We're going to be standing at the top there and looking around. You can see around 360 degrees. Are you going to make it? Yeah. I think she'll make it. I haven't got shoes on. Just get her good shoes on. We're walking up this circular path and you can see it goes all the way around to the tower. There's frickin' alligators everywhere. You notice here? That's the only remains of the guy that fell off this bridge. Just his hat. And there's the gator. There's the gator that ate the guy. Is he alive? Well, the guy isn't anymore, but the gator is. To be continued...\nComment: Hey nice video. Been to Shark Valley many a time.

The babies are quiet. See? The babies are quiet. She's backing up three babies. We're just going to roll them by real slow. She's not real happy. See how protected she is? Unlike most reptiles, turtles or whatever that lay their eggs and then go back in the water. That's in a motherhood. Now a gator is more like a panther in the way the female protects her babies. And she will protect her babies not only from birds and otters or whatever is coming after them. She will have to protect her babies from turtles. Come back. Relax. We're at the tower here at Shark Island. I'm going to zoom in. Just laying on the grass there. Yeah. Is this another little one over here? Yeah. Push it. Is that another little one right here? That thing's a monster. It's crazy. Push it. Okay, we're heading to the tower at Shark Island. We just saw a whole bunch of alligators. Probably about six. And they were mothers with babies. And we're just walking to the tower right now. The tower is right there. We're going to be standing at the top there and looking around. You can see around 360 degrees. Are you going to make it? Yeah. I think she'll make it. I haven't got shoes on. Just get her good shoes on. We're walking up this circular path and you can see it goes all the way around to the tower. There's frickin' alligators everywhere. You notice here? That's the only remains of the guy that fell off this bridge. Just his hat. And there's the gator. There's the gator that ate the guy. Is he alive? Well, the guy isn't anymore, but the gator is. To be continued...\nComment: alligators are all too common here and monster turtles. lol\nlol @ \"little ones don't eat?\"  haha \nvery interesting video.  :D\n\nI miss the furry and cute animals of the north.  reptiles and amphibians are all over the place down here...it would be nice to see a squirrel, a chipmunk or even a rabbit from time to time.

We've just arrived at the school playground where there's an adult male roe deer unable to get out. There's a lot of blood on the ground, we're not sure whether it's because he's been running on the concrete or he's got an injury. Because he's down we're going to try to see if we can get to a point where we can get this little jab stick over him and get it into him because we know he'll then go to sleep very quickly. But it's not the easiest thing and they usually don't stand it, but it will save us having to try to catch him. Right, that was the end of that one. Absolutely screwed the needle. Okay, didn't work people. He's quite calm at the moment, but he could so easily jump over that fence just back and forth. Sean's got him really well contained, he's just very steady behind him keeping him calm. But we don't know where he's going to go from. Well, that was a much more sedate rescue than it might have been. The wound on his flank is very old, he's done it a long time ago. We can put a bit of gel on that and maybe give him an antibiotic. It's really old, it's healed. We just need to see where all this blood's coming from. I think the blood's from his hooves. These have bled and you can see where he's gone backwards and forwards across that end part. He's got a cut on either eye as well. That's old. This side's not quite so old. He's been in the wars a bit. He has. These are all really old injuries, they're completely dry. I've got the antlers protected so he can't do you any damage, will he? OK, I'm ready. OK, let's go on. Come on, fella. Steady. Get Lucy's expression well, Andy. No, don't. OK, we good? Well, the deer's here. Didn't have to walk very far. I'm not sure whether Lucy's ever going to walk again. She looks absolutely knackered. But he's ready to go. He's gorgeous. Straight into woodland from this field. He shouldn't go back towards the school, so he's on his own again for his second chance. We're looking at him probably as third or fourth chance, to be honest. Right, OK. And off you go, fella. Relaxed, wasn't he? He's really looking good. Just toddling off at his own pace, really. I'm in no rush. I'm back home. She's actually had five minutes to recover. But you can tell how unfit our vet nurse is, can't you? She might be good at her job. Get her to walk 200 yards and she's... Look at it. You're so naughty. If I hadn't had what I had, you'd have got an antler in the face.\nComment: So basically... that's the Rambo of the roe deer world you caught there- All scared up but still going strong like a true fighter :P And I hope you gave Lucy some IV fluids after that, she looks like she needed it. And she is far too good to loose so keep her alive will you ;)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

With him I had the privilege of watching and recording a very special moment for this story: dingo pups being born in their lair.It is just one special moment in a story about a farmer who has come up with an unusual way of keeping wild dogs under control on his property.    by Ant On Wax\"Before You Accuse Me\" blues standard performed by Harmonica Rick Gibson soundcloud.com/harmonica-rick-gibson\nTranscript: Australian farmers have a responsibility to control dingoes, or wild dogs, that are running on their property. So about three years ago, I made a decision to change my strategy about controlling wild dogs on my property and decided to go and look for the young at brooding time, which was July. The dingoes have their pups in July. And I was lucky enough to find two litters, and having reared a couple of those dingoes, I got to the understanding that I could probably try a policy of having my own dingo pack and regularly walk them around my property and might be able to control the other of the wild dingo pack by letting them know there was already a pack of dogs in this area. The culmination of my efforts through removing these pups from the hollow logs means that now I have mature dingoes, who are now brooding age, and just only a few nights ago I was very privileged to be present for the birth of my own. I'm right up close and it's all happening just natural like a wood in the bush, except the dingo doesn't have a fear of me and accepts me in. I just feel so privileged to be able to be right up close to something that is normally so secretive. An interesting characteristic I found with dingoes, they don't normally bark, but they have a whole heap of other noises they make in communication, quiet communications, and they do a very throaty, I think a dingo could almost talk. Come up here baby. Yes I will. My lovely dingo baby. Go on. And I learned early on sitting here by the campfire, when I had dingo pups beside me, that when I played the harmonica, they all went into howl. I don't really know whether they think I'm sad or what it is with the harmonica that really gets into them, but all they want to do is come and sit beside me and howl with me. I feed my dingoes a variety of foods. I like to get a big boiler, half fill it with water, put in vegetables. I try to give them as much native food that they would naturally have got themselves. You can't always count on a roadkill kangaroo or something coming along when you need it. They all seem quite happy. I think they do well on it as a matter of fact. I feel privileged to have actually seen what happens with dingoes right up close. They're so misunderstood in Australia. I really realise how much they have accepted me as I'm just one of a number. And I have some very good traits. All dingoes have their part in the pack. I suppose one of my best traits must be they consider me a good cook. Baa! Eee! No! Mm-mm!\nComment: From this video it seems the dingos can be domesticated? Is this true? Could the same wild dog protection be achieved with a domesticated breed such as the Maremma?

With him I had the privilege of watching and recording a very special moment for this story: dingo pups being born in their lair.It is just one special moment in a story about a farmer who has come up with an unusual way of keeping wild dogs under control on his property.    by Ant On Wax\"Before You Accuse Me\" blues standard performed by Harmonica Rick Gibson soundcloud.com/harmonica-rick-gibson\nTranscript: Australian farmers have a responsibility to control dingoes, or wild dogs, that are running on their property. So about three years ago, I made a decision to change my strategy about controlling wild dogs on my property and decided to go and look for the young at brooding time, which was July. The dingoes have their pups in July. And I was lucky enough to find two litters, and having reared a couple of those dingoes, I got to the understanding that I could probably try a policy of having my own dingo pack and regularly walk them around my property and might be able to control the other of the wild dingo pack by letting them know there was already a pack of dogs in this area. The culmination of my efforts through removing these pups from the hollow logs means that now I have mature dingoes, who are now brooding age, and just only a few nights ago I was very privileged to be present for the birth of my own. I'm right up close and it's all happening just natural like a wood in the bush, except the dingo doesn't have a fear of me and accepts me in. I just feel so privileged to be able to be right up close to something that is normally so secretive. An interesting characteristic I found with dingoes, they don't normally bark, but they have a whole heap of other noises they make in communication, quiet communications, and they do a very throaty, I think a dingo could almost talk. Come up here baby. Yes I will. My lovely dingo baby. Go on. And I learned early on sitting here by the campfire, when I had dingo pups beside me, that when I played the harmonica, they all went into howl. I don't really know whether they think I'm sad or what it is with the harmonica that really gets into them, but all they want to do is come and sit beside me and howl with me. I feed my dingoes a variety of foods. I like to get a big boiler, half fill it with water, put in vegetables. I try to give them as much native food that they would naturally have got themselves. You can't always count on a roadkill kangaroo or something coming along when you need it. They all seem quite happy. I think they do well on it as a matter of fact. I feel privileged to have actually seen what happens with dingoes right up close. They're so misunderstood in Australia. I really realise how much they have accepted me as I'm just one of a number. And I have some very good traits. All dingoes have their part in the pack. I suppose one of my best traits must be they consider me a good cook. Baa! Eee! No!

Yeah, yeah, look at that. Drilled him. Drilled him. Yeah, that's a good shot. Yeah. That's what I was thinking. Look at this. Looky here. Look what we got. Look. Yeah. Look at that shot placement. That was a good shot. You know, I ran out of venison a couple months ago. I'm eating again now. That's right. You're eating good. What a beautiful, beautiful trophy. Look at this. Look how big his neck is. Oh, look at that. Look at the brows. Yeah. Kind of dark colored. Look at the mass. Even kind of palmated trying to do here. That's very good. And what do you think the length? 34, 36, in between there. That's what we're looking for. Yeah. And real good brows. You know, we've been hunting for three days. Yep. Three brutal days, 103, 104 degrees. Yep. Sitting on stand from 5 till 9 in the afternoons, burning up. It's all worth it. And you know, here's your reward. You get out of hunting what you put into it. That's right. I want to thank you for putting in that hard work for me. You're welcome. Putting in the hard work, putting me on this deer, putting up with the heat, and putting up with me. Thank you. Thank you. You ready? Yeah, I'm ready. Now the fun part. You're going to clean it, right? Yes. Yep. That would be a treat, but I'll help you. All right. Let's go. It looks good right there. It'll look good on the wall, too. Thank you. Wow. Yummy.\nComment: Yeah, The Axis Deer meat is better than venison, but in my opinion, it's only marginally better. Cooked properly, it's EXCELLENT! I didn't do research, but it seems that the Axis Doe esterus cycle can occur any time during the year, unlike the Whitetail which they all go into esterus at the same time. So, the Bucks are growing Antlers at different times of the year insuring that Bucks are available for breeding anytime Does are ready. I really appreciate you tuning into this video!!

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: I long for the day when clear cutting rain forest will be seen as a crime against the planet."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

I feel that because it is the same for me.  \nIf you feel that way then please think, what can I do to reverse this?  The damage is great but that does not mean that we have to watch our world die one species at a time.  \nThere comes a time when we must choose between what is right and what is easy.\nBeing involved doesn't have to be a big thing, sometimes whats needed is widespread knowledge of an issue and a lot of constant contribution.  \nEveryone has different skills that can be brought to making a change.

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: Poachers should be an endangered species!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: Very nice, very informative, sure wish more people cared and understood, once it's gone, it's gone for ever!

I have watched all your uploads and I have subscribed your channel long back. As, I am a Keralite, love for elephants were always in my blood. Even though, my desire is to have an elephant of my own, not for making money but as a pet to love and live with is my dream, which is actually against the low of nature. \nWatching them in their natural habitat and their own life,with their families without any constrains gives me immense pleasure.  \nAnd the effort which you are taking for shooting these are really appreciable. \nkudos to you. \nAlso, I have a request, I know its your videos and its your effort, then too, please avoid those animations and pop-ups of your pics in between the videos. \nIt is highly unprofessional and spoils the view. Like how you have done in this video. \nYou can show it at the beginning or at any sides rather than showing at the center.  \nIts a request, hope you understand what I have meant. \n\nRegards"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

We've had these chickadees in this nest for quite a few weeks now and with all the cats around here, they rarely ever make it. Yeah, they're flying all around. Boy, there might be four babies. There's baby number four just getting ready. There's the fourth one. It came out and landed on the ground. I'm going to stay here so the cat doesn't get it. That's one chickadee that just about got ate. Apologize for the sound of the lawnmower, but it's pretty neat. Four baby chickadees. This is like the true survival story right here. All these birds never make it because there's just too many cats around here. This is kind of a messed up situation. I'm about four foot away from this bird and I want to leave them alone so that they can go about their natural way, but as soon as I leave, that cat is going to come and eat this bird. It'll get ate if it doesn't get its flying wings. There's their nest in the lower right hand of the screen. I left that one alone. We shooed away the cats, so hopefully the mama can get this little one that was sitting on that metal ring to fly up in the tree with the others, but you can hear them everywhere.

First time I have seen one that had growths on it. While I do have some pity for the rabbit, I don't see the need to have a vet come and take a look at it. It's a wild animal.

Momma squirrel moves her babies I was standing out back and watched momma squirrel move a baby, so I ran to grab the camera and recorded this.Nibbler is a tame wild pet squirrel that lives in the trees outside of my home. You can see all of his videos from birth onward at his Facebook page: \nTranscript: Watch this, she's grabbing a baby. I know this because she's moved one already. I was out here. Oh, here it goes. She's got a baby in her mouth. Look at that. It's not something you get to see every day. Mama squirrel has a baby. She's just taking it with her. I just ran inside to get the camera so I could get this. Oh, there's a nest right above my head there. There's one up there already. So now I know she has two babies. And I guess she decided that that nest is a better place than the box. And I have a feeling why. I wasn't leaving her alone. I put a bowl of food up there thinking I was doing her a favor. But now I realize that she doesn't want her babies near food. Because the food not only doesn't draw other squirrels, which would be a problem, but it draws other animals. So I made a mistake. I basically kicked her out of the nest box by giving her some food. So I learned something. She has another baby in her mouth right there. I don't know if it's on camera, but I can see it and I don't know where she's going with it. Oh, there's another nest. Look at that. She's just nest hopping with her babies. That's interesting. Well, so far I've seen two babies. That's one. And here she goes. Where did she go? Where'd you go, Mama Bear? There you are. Interesting. Oh, no, she's got a baby again. Look at that. She's trying out different nests. That is the craziest thing. I have never seen a squirrel moving a baby. There she is. She's going back. She's moving it back now. I don't believe it. She's putting it back. And it's just in her mouth and it's not crying or screaming or anything. Now she's putting it back. I don't believe it. I guess the nests weren't good enough. Okay. So now there's one baby back in the wooden box. I suspect she's going to come back here and grab the second one. That is crazy. Here she comes. She just popped out of the box and she's going to come back to where I am and grab the other baby. I know this because I saw her bring it over here. Hey, mama. Now she's going to go up to that nest straight up and get a baby. And I am going to show. Wouldn't it be interesting if these babies were nibblers? Obviously, there's no way to tell such a thing, but that would be cool. There she is. She's at the nest now. I can't tell because I'm looking straight up. I can't tell if the camera can see this. Okay, she's grabbed the baby. And it's in her mouth. Alright, here she comes. Oh my gosh, she's right in front of me. Hey sweetie, it's okay. Go on. Oh, and the baby's just hanging there. Oh, it's so cute. That is so cute. Alright, two babies safe in the box. I'll remember next time. I'm not going to put food up there anymore. Hopefully she keeps them there.

Until they run out of places to move.\n\nOh, I hadn't gotten to the part she moved them back! See, she liked the original spot, after all!\nThey don't want ANY smell around the nest. I'm about to stop feeding mine on the porch, so that they'll use the nesting box I made them. They even clean the feces and urine out of the nest, to keep the scent down.

I just ran inside to get the camera so I could get this. Oh, there's a nest right above my head there. There's one up there already. So now I know she has two babies. And I guess she decided that that nest is a better place than the box. And I have a feeling why. I wasn't leaving her alone. I put a bowl of food up there thinking I was doing her a favor. But now I realize that she doesn't want her babies near food. Because the food not only doesn't draw other squirrels, which would be a problem, but it draws other animals. So I made a mistake. I basically kicked her out of the nest box by giving her some food. So I learned something. She has another baby in her mouth right there. I don't know if it's on camera, but I can see it and I don't know where she's going with it. Oh, there's another nest. Look at that. She's just nest hopping with her babies. That's interesting. Well, so far I've seen two babies. That's one. And here she goes. Where did she go? Where'd you go, Mama Bear? There you are. Interesting. Oh, no, she's got a baby again. Look at that. She's trying out different nests. That is the craziest thing. I have never seen a squirrel moving a baby. There she is. She's going back. She's moving it back now. I don't believe it. She's putting it back. And it's just in her mouth and it's not crying or screaming or anything. Now she's putting it back. I don't believe it. I guess the nests weren't good enough. Okay. So now there's one baby back in the wooden box. I suspect she's going to come back here and grab the second one. That is crazy. Here she comes. She just popped out of the box and she's going to come back to where I am and grab the other baby. I know this because I saw her bring it over here. Hey, mama. Now she's going to go up to that nest straight up and get a baby. And I am going to show. Wouldn't it be interesting if these babies were nibblers? Obviously, there's no way to tell such a thing, but that would be cool. There she is. She's at the nest now. I can't tell because I'm looking straight up. I can't tell if the camera can see this. Okay, she's grabbed the baby. And it's in her mouth. Alright, here she comes. Oh my gosh, she's right in front of me. Hey sweetie, it's okay. Go on. Oh, and the baby's just hanging there. Oh, it's so cute. That is so cute. Alright, two babies safe in the box. I'll remember next time. I'm not going to put food up there anymore. Hopefully she keeps them there. Maybe I can tame up another pair of squirrels. That would be so neat.\nComment: Just watched a squirrel do this. The mother was tiny....very young mother, and the babies were about 35-40% her size!!! I watched her come across the street and at first thought, that has to be a baby, but she moved from the yard next to the yard across a double wide street, went through my yard, over a fence and up another tree. I saw her close and thought it was a large tumor of something!!! It was twice the size of her little head hanging down in front and though it might be something growing on her neck. Took 2 or 3 short rests...just a couple seconds. Wasn't sure. Then I saw a squirrel come from where she had been and head across the street again, and I thought, if I see another I know it is her carrying babies. Sure enough, she did it again. About 60-75 yards, Down a tree, up over a fence, across 1 yard, across a VERY wide street, and then through my yard, over a fence, and up a tree. With the ups and downs, over 100 yards easy. She went back a 3rd time, and I walked toward the corner, in case a car came, to let them know what was going on so they didn't hit her. A lot of people don't want squirrels around for some good reasons I guess, getting into the house, chewing wires etc, but I hope none want to see a mother with babies killed. Only one car came, but this time, she stopped right in the middle of the street....exhausted...rested for 20 seconds and continued on, stopping every 10-15 yards to rest for 10-20 seconds now. She repeated this with a 4th!!! VERY tired. I put some peanuts and craisins (dried cranberries) out for her, and a bowl of water so she wouldn't have to go too far for food. She was a baby herself. Wondered what caused her to move. A cat? Hawks? Birds to close? Nest blown down from the tree? Nest infested with fleas is another reason I found online. The 3rd one was funny. They all looked like a bundle of laundry in a gray sack, but that one also had his tail wrapped around her head!!! lol.....If people worked as hard as squirrels do, even at minimum wage, we would all be millionaires in no time!!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Finally breaking the camera out again and decided to walk some land in search of sheds, enjoy!\nTranscript: Hey guys, what's up? It's Champlea7. I know I haven't made a video in a super long time, but my camera is actually out of commission right now. I left it at my buddy's house and I haven't seen him for about two months. I went on a hog hunt with him, so I'm using my buddy, the Texas Bone Hunters video camera. And I'm back here on a wildlife management area today near my house in Dallas, Texas. It's about 15 minutes from my house and there's got to be a couple thousand acres back here I'm thinking. I mean, there is just a ton of land to come in here and I mean, I'm kind of just trail hopping right now. I'm doing a shed hunting video today. It's January the 27th or the 28th, one of the two days, Saturday, but I'm back here ready to find some sheds, hopefully bring you guys a quality video, so stay tuned. Well, guys, I know you're probably watching this video to get a couple of shed hunting information from me, so I'm going to share some with you right now, guys. First thing, this is a really new area to me. I really haven't come back here a lot. I've come back here to do a little bit of bow fishing. You might have seen some of my bow fishing videos, but I noticed a lot of the land that was back from where I bow fish is a wildlife management area, so that's why I'm in here today. This is really my first time in here and what you want to do, you really want to pick apart your cover whenever you're shed hunting. Look for any sort of geographic region that might hold deer more, like openings within some really heavily wooded forests. Look for a sign. Keep away from those areas that are devoid of signs. Try not to trail hop. I'm really guilty of doing that a lot. I do get lucky sometimes trail hopping, but you could probably find a lot more if you look for a sign. I've got a rub right here in front of me. These deer in Texas actually rut around late December into January, so I know that this is probably kind of fresh and there's some deer hanging around here, but I know a lot of bucks still haven't shed right now, especially here in the Lone Star State because we're so far south. It's really not a hard winter on these deer, so I'm really looking for older sheds maybe. Just anything that might be in here. There's a ton of woods. There's no way someone's covered at all, so I'm going to try to get a couple finds. So stick around. Hey guys, the Texas bone hunter is over here. He's found some bone. Let's see what he's got. He's probably already picked it up here. Man, this is some thick stuff. I can't believe deer are walking through here. Yeah, I know. That is a very nice shed. Was it laying right there? Well, yeah. I mean, it's not even chewed up or anything, dude. Yeah. That's an awesome shed. It's all... Yeah, it's in very good condition. Very good condition. I don't know how long I've been wanting to find a shed for myself, dude, now. Yeah? I'm so pumped. So it was right here, huh? Yeah. Wow. Very nice. Well guys, just found this bad boy right here. Little boar, it looks like. Pretty good cutters on him, actually. This spot of the woods back here is definitely dominated by pigs. You can just tell it's all tore up in here and pigs everywhere. But I found the bottom skull and then found the top skull not even 5 or 10 yards away from it. Pretty easy find and a pretty cool thing to add to my collection. So we're starting to hit some bone here now, whether it be skull or actual sheds. We'll keep in tune, guys, so stay with us. Hey guys, just found my first antler here. I haven't even gone to pick it up yet. I'm going to do an ATL picture of it with my phone and on the camera. But I am excited. It looks really good. I'm about 15 yards away from it right now. So let's go see it. Oh man. Wow, that's a good shed. Ha. Guys, we're on some wildlife management area land here. In Texas. And by God, he's got a split brow. It's pretty nice. A G2 and G3 and he's pretty chunky for being back here. Man. Well, that's awesome. I'm glad we got one, guys. I'm ready to go find some more. Oh my God. Wow. Alright. I ain't kidding you guys right now. I just want to do a walking away shot with this shed. And there's another shed not even laying 10 yards away. Right on the same trail. Looks to be pretty old. So there's some more. Shed's obviously to be found. Keep watching, guys. Wow. Alright, guys. What I'm doing now is what's called gridding. After finding those two antlers, there's a pretty good chance that the other one's going to be pretty close by. So what you want to do is wherever you found that antler, just kind of go back and forth. Help you use landmarks. And trying to find the other side. Basically making a big sweep where you can't miss it. You're not trail hopping. You're doing more of a systematic search. So stay with me. And I'll check in if I get anything.

Finally breaking the camera out again and decided to walk some land in search of sheds, enjoy!\nTranscript: Hey guys, what's up? It's Champlea7. I know I haven't made a video in a super long time, but my camera is actually out of commission right now. I left it at my buddy's house and I haven't seen him for about two months. I went on a hog hunt with him, so I'm using my buddy, the Texas Bone Hunters video camera. And I'm back here on a wildlife management area today near my house in Dallas, Texas. It's about 15 minutes from my house and there's got to be a couple thousand acres back here I'm thinking. I mean, there is just a ton of land to come in here and I mean, I'm kind of just trail hopping right now. I'm doing a shed hunting video today. It's January the 27th or the 28th, one of the two days, Saturday, but I'm back here ready to find some sheds, hopefully bring you guys a quality video, so stay tuned. Well, guys, I know you're probably watching this video to get a couple of shed hunting information from me, so I'm going to share some with you right now, guys. First thing, this is a really new area to me. I really haven't come back here a lot. I've come back here to do a little bit of bow fishing. You might have seen some of my bow fishing videos, but I noticed a lot of the land that was back from where I bow fish is a wildlife management area, so that's why I'm in here today. This is really my first time in here and what you want to do, you really want to pick apart your cover whenever you're shed hunting. Look for any sort of geographic region that might hold deer more, like openings within some really heavily wooded forests. Look for a sign. Keep away from those areas that are devoid of signs. Try not to trail hop. I'm really guilty of doing that a lot. I do get lucky sometimes trail hopping, but you could probably find a lot more if you look for a sign. I've got a rub right here in front of me. These deer in Texas actually rut around late December into January, so I know that this is probably kind of fresh and there's some deer hanging around here, but I know a lot of bucks still haven't shed right now, especially here in the Lone Star State because we're so far south. It's really not a hard winter on these deer, so I'm really looking for older sheds maybe. Just anything that might be in here. There's a ton of woods. There's no way someone's covered at all, so I'm going to try to get a couple finds. So stick around. Hey guys, the Texas bone hunter is over here. He's found some bone. Let's see what he's got. He's probably already picked it up here. Man, this is some thick stuff. I can't believe deer are walking through here. Yeah, I know. That is a very nice shed. Was it laying right there? Well, yeah. I mean, it's not even chewed up or anything, dude. Yeah. That's an awesome shed. It's all... Yeah, it's in very good condition. Very good condition. I don't know how long I've been wanting to find a shed for myself, dude, now. Yeah? I'm so pumped. So it was right here, huh? Yeah. Wow. Very nice. Well guys, just found this bad boy right here. Little boar, it looks like. Pretty good cutters on him, actually. This spot of the woods back here is definitely dominated by pigs. You can just tell it's all tore up in here and pigs everywhere. But I found the bottom skull and then found the top skull not even 5 or 10 yards away from it. Pretty easy find and a pretty cool thing to add to my collection. So we're starting to hit some bone here now, whether it be skull or actual sheds. We'll keep in tune, guys, so stay with us. Hey guys, just found my first antler here. I haven't even gone to pick it up yet. I'm going to do an ATL picture of it with my phone and on the camera. But I am excited. It looks really good. I'm about 15 yards away from it right now.

Even a small wild cat can inflict serious injury.In this episode we look at a lesser cat called the Caracal. Their name is taken from a Turkish word that means \"black ear.\" The Caracal is known best for its large black ears that it uses for its great hunting ability.The Caracal roams the grasslands and open plains from Africa through the Middle East. While its numbers are holding in Africa, we see populations becoming extinct in India due to farming and the unrestricted manufacturing of charcoal from the wild weeds, especially in the Banni grasslands. By supporting animal conservation in these areas we can help save the land for the Caracals and other wildlife. Captive Caracals in the US suffer from people trying to keep them as pets, as well as trying to crossbreed them with domestic cats for the pet trade.For more info about BIG CAT RESCUE visit:  us on FACEBOOK:     YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, so today's species spotlight is on the caracal, which most people say, what is a caracal? Well, we're going to show you one and talk a little bit about them. That is Crackle, and she is a caracal. Caracals are sometimes called desert lynx, but in all reality, they are more closely related to your domestic cat at home than to any of the lynx, being either Siberian lynx or Canadian lynx. One of the characteristics that make them very unique is the fact that they have a pretty plain solid coat. There are only a few other cats that have that sort of coat without markings, and that would be cougars and lions, and strangely enough, they are about the same color as the caracals. The caracals have jet black ears, the back of their ears are black, and they have long tufts, just like the lynx, so that's probably why a lot of people associated them with the lynx or thought they were related. So caracals are found throughout Africa, and they're actually found through the Middle East and parts of Asia, and strangely enough, geographically, caracals are found in the same areas that you find cheetahs. Cheetahs and caracals were found in actually the same locations, and one of the things about these two species is they were both trained by humans to hunt animals on behalf of the humans. So the caracals were trained to hunt birds, rabbits, small gazelles, and of course the cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey. Very fascinating that both of these animals were not tamed, but conditioned by humans to hunt animals, and there was actually contests at one time between the caracals to see which one could kill the most birds, the most pigeons in a flock, and the cheetahs, which one could go fastest and bring down the biggest prey. For the most part, the smaller cats, the smaller predators, they eat animals relative to their size, so they would eat smaller birds or mice, but the caracals actually go after much larger prey. So one of the coolest things about the caracals is that they have this uncanny leaping ability, and they can actually catch birds on the wing. They've been recorded in the wild as jumping up to three meters high, which is almost about as high as I am right now. One of the other facts about caracals is they often live in the plains, and a lot of times they're found where the forest meets the plains. This does put them vulnerable to lions, hyenas, leopards, some of the bigger predators, and oftentimes they do fall prey to these larger animals. So they're not always the hunter, a lot of times they become the hunted. So one of the strange things about the caracal is in a lot of their range, especially in Asia and the Middle East, they're considered endangered, because they're very rare. And then on the other hand, in Africa, a lot of times caracals are considered nuisance, and they're just simply killed because they're a threat to livestock. Here at Big Cat Rescue, all of our caracals were former pets. Along with the serval, the caracal is just very popular among cat collectors, and probably one of the biggest misconceptions with the caracals is the fact that they are so cute when they are babies. They are the most adorable little kittens you've ever seen. Most people don't realize they're going to grow up to be this hissy animal that's going to spray on everything and try to bite you all the time. And there's been several attempts to hybridize these animals, some successful, some not successful, with domestic cats to give everyone sort of an exotic cat that's not quite wild. To me, that's a pretty shady thing to do. These are truly wild animals, great hunters out in the wild. They shouldn't be put in cages. They absolutely shouldn't be diluted down with domestic cat DNA. That's not what they were made to be. And here at Big Cat Rescue, of course, our philosophy is these animals belong in the wild, and the only way that we can ever accomplish that is if we preserve enough habitat in the \nComment: @MinsterRogers It's the only thought we should have, these cats will never be domesticated but they will always be dangerous, the only place they should be is in the wild.

Even a small wild cat can inflict serious injury.In this episode we look at a lesser cat called the Caracal. Their name is taken from a Turkish word that means \"black ear.\" The Caracal is known best for its large black ears that it uses for its great hunting ability.The Caracal roams the grasslands and open plains from Africa through the Middle East. While its numbers are holding in Africa, we see populations becoming extinct in India due to farming and the unrestricted manufacturing of charcoal from the wild weeds, especially in the Banni grasslands. By supporting animal conservation in these areas we can help save the land for the Caracals and other wildlife. Captive Caracals in the US suffer from people trying to keep them as pets, as well as trying to crossbreed them with domestic cats for the pet trade.For more info about BIG CAT RESCUE visit:  us on FACEBOOK:     YOU!\nTranscript: Okay, so today's species spotlight is on the caracal, which most people say, what is a caracal? Well, we're going to show you one and talk a little bit about them. That is Crackle, and she is a caracal. Caracals are sometimes called desert lynx, but in all reality, they are more closely related to your domestic cat at home than to any of the lynx, being either Siberian lynx or Canadian lynx. One of the characteristics that make them very unique is the fact that they have a pretty plain solid coat. There are only a few other cats that have that sort of coat without markings, and that would be cougars and lions, and strangely enough, they are about the same color as the caracals. The caracals have jet black ears, the back of their ears are black, and they have long tufts, just like the lynx, so that's probably why a lot of people associated them with the lynx or thought they were related. So caracals are found throughout Africa, and they're actually found through the Middle East and parts of Asia, and strangely enough, geographically, caracals are found in the same areas that you find cheetahs. Cheetahs and caracals were found in actually the same locations, and one of the things about these two species is they were both trained by humans to hunt animals on behalf of the humans. So the caracals were trained to hunt birds, rabbits, small gazelles, and of course the cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey. Very fascinating that both of these animals were not tamed, but conditioned by humans to hunt animals, and there was actually contests at one time between the caracals to see which one could kill the most birds, the most pigeons in a flock, and the cheetahs, which one could go fastest and bring down the biggest prey. For the most part, the smaller cats, the smaller predators, they eat animals relative to their size, so they would eat smaller birds or mice, but the caracals actually go after much larger prey. So one of the coolest things about the caracals is that they have this uncanny leaping ability, and they can actually catch birds on the wing. They've been recorded in the wild as jumping up to three meters high, which is almost about as high as I am right now. One of the other facts about caracals is they often live in the plains, and a lot of times they're found where the forest meets the plains. This does put them vulnerable to lions, hyenas, leopards, some of the bigger predators, and oftentimes they do fall prey to these larger animals. So they're not always the hunter, a lot of times they become the hunted. So one of the strange things about the caracal is in a lot of their range, especially in Asia and the Middle East, they're considered endangered, because they're very rare. And then on the other hand, in Africa, a lot of times caracals are considered nuisance, and they're just simply killed because they're a threat to livestock. Here at Big Cat Rescue, all of our caracals were former pets.
