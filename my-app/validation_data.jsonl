This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: You can come volunteer or intern at the sanctuary!

That's the pond pulled to bits, we've removed the large stones from around the side, we've kept them fairly local, just tipped them over the back there to allow us to reshape the top shelf, we've whipped the liner out, there was a little bit of underlay in, carpet underlay, probably covering about 20% of the pond, so it was there as a token gesture, no more, we've dragged the cobbles back a little bit, that'll allow us to build a proper shelf here to retain the cobbles and then just push them back in so they don't need to be moved twice, same with the stones, once we get the shelves done around the sides we'll just be able to lift the stones back into position and cement them in. Right this morning we've reshaped the pond, we've dug the shelves a little bit deeper all the way around the edges, we've created a new shelf around here, the idea being to put a little bit of cement all the way along here, cement in some of these fellas and then pile the rest behind it to prevent them falling in. We've made this inner shelf around here a little bit taller, i.e. a little bit nearer the surface because there wasn't much space for putting marginal plants before, that shelf was pretty deep, it was about 18 inches, which is no good for most plants, we've made another little shelf in the bottom here and we've basically just flattened everything out, ready for the underlay. That's the underlay in now, more or less went in in two long sheets, that's one sheet, that's another sheet, we've sealed it with a heat gun, basically just put a little bit of fire between the two layers and pressed them together in this stick. So now it's time for the liner. That's the liner in now, it's one mil rubber, Firestone liner, we've started filling it up, we're probably going to fill it up until it's just over this shelf here, that should pull the liner in enough for us to work on this top shelf, cementing the stones in. It's pretty important to fill it up sufficiently so it pulls the liner in and makes it tight, otherwise if you just bray on and put the edging stones on when the liner's loose, when you fill it up, it can pull the edging stones in and make a real mess. This is the edging just about half done, we're putting a little ring of cobbles cemented in around the beach edge here, then we can cut the liner off, pour the cobbles back over that and it retains the cobbles quite nicely. We've gone round the sides with stone, well gone halfway round the side with stone, obviously the water's still got quite a long way to come up, but we're going to stop it just shy of those stones there, just in case we get any rain overnight, we don't want it to affect the cement that we've put on. All these gaps will be filled in with soil and then we'll cut the liner off. It's coming together quite well. It's the end of today, we've cemented all the edging stones on, put the cobbles back in position, had a bit of a tidy up around the edges, the water's still got to go up by 8 or 9 inches or so to cover the exposed liner there, but we're leaving it at this level just so it doesn't interfere with the cement. So really now all there is to do is just leave it for a couple of days, top it up and then get the video of the finished pond. That's about it. We've filled the pond up to about 6 inches below its full level, that's to allow the cement that we put around here to go off properly, that was the last bit of cementing that we did, so it'll still come up, probably halfway up these stones that surround the pond here. It's reasonably clear because most of it is water straight out of the tap, although we did put a little bit of pond water back in, it was probably about 300-400 litres went back in. That's it, another one down. If you've liked this video, click the like button, give it a thumbs up, if you haven't liked it, go away and watch some cat playing a blooming keyboard or something.

A new foal is trying to stand for the first time. Try as it will, the little foal's back legs just don't seem to work. The mare guards it from her curious two-year-old son. As the hours pass, I realize something's wrong. Even the band's stallion, Boomer, tries to encourage the foal. That's when another band moves into the meadow, led by the husky stallion, Looking Glass. Boomer's little band moves away. And the foal tries, but cannot follow. Looking Glass's lead mare notices something in the grass. She's joined by a second mare and a young stallion. She seems to encourage the foal, while Boomer's band looks on. Then Looking Glass approaches. And I was shocked at what happened next. The mares try to stop him. Boomer charges in, but it's too late. I tell myself the stallion did the foal a favor, saving it from a lingering death. But Looking Glass's aggression is disturbing and haunting.\nComment: I have this DVD. It's a documentary of wild mustangs living in Montana. The foal couldn't walk for some reason, and when you think about it, the stallion did the foal a favor. He saved it from a slow death of starvation, but it is terrible that the foal didn't have a chance to live because of it's legs."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

You don't see many mammals, far fewer than in African or South American forests. But what this place lacks in mammals, it makes up for in birds. Not that it's all that easy to see them. You know they're around because you can hear them. But if you want to watch them, you have to move fairly quietly. And there is one of the smallest of the whole family. This is the one with those extraordinary sawtooth plumes, the King of Saxony's bird. There's nothing else remotely like these plumes in the whole of the bird world. He's calling for a female. And it's not just his plumes that are unique. So is his way of dancing. This is the King of Saxony, and this is his wife, the Queen of Saxony. That hissing noise is his calling. You can tell he's getting particularly excited because he's erected the black feathers on his shoulders into a cape, another of those transformation tricks that seem to be a speciality of this family.

I mean, the views, the animals, you know, they had elk, we saw some pronghorn, we even saw a color phase black bear. This place was just magnificent. Alright, so Scott drops us off at this property and this pasture he puts us in front of is absolutely huge. It has to be 2,000 acres and he pointed out this corral way out in the middle, he said just go sit there. These dogs like to run these guts, these ravines and so Andy and I made our way out there and we started making ourselves a little blind, took some old logs, stacking them up. I go to put the mojo out and I come back, Andy's glassed in the field, he says stop what you're doing, I think I see a coyote. Sure enough, we look out, there's two little earsy spots and I just sit down and enough time for this dog to stand up, we lay on the calls and this dog comes sprinting in. Alright, ready? I'm ready.

The mother fox, also known as the fox vixen, has five kits or cubs. Her babies have just begun to spend time above ground. The fox vixen routinely feeds them, mostly with her milk, but today she gives them an animal bone to chew. They stay inside the underground den, waiting for her to arrive. When she does, she will use soft vocalizations to get their attention. The fox cubs spend up to an hour above ground whenever she comes to feed and attend. Fox cubs like play and will wrestle and fight each other for fun. The red fox is a carnivorous meat-eating canine mammal animal predator that hunts other animals when it is feeding and dining; they are carnivores with excellent hunting skills for catching a large variety of animals including birds and other smaller mammal animals. Their keen eyesight and hearing help them achieve the necessary amount of successful pounce and attack animal prey hunts; although the red foxes are predators, they will occasionally eat different plants and fruit, and grains when foraging nutritional food to add to their predatorial meat-eater diets.

I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also.

The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: While watching I hear this song in my head...\n\nIt goes: Oh Give me a home where the buffalo roam and the deer and the antelope play...\n\ngreat video - thank you for sharing!\n\nMediumRoastEspresso"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission.\nComment: Wow that's really cleaver!

You don't see many mammals, far fewer than in African or South American forests. But what this place lacks in mammals, it makes up for in birds. Not that it's all that easy to see them. You know they're around because you can hear them. But if you want to watch them, you have to move fairly quietly. And there is one of the smallest of the whole family. This is the one with those extraordinary sawtooth plumes, the King of Saxony's bird. There's nothing else remotely like these plumes in the whole of the bird world. He's calling for a female. And it's not just his plumes that are unique. So is his way of dancing. This is the King of Saxony, and this is his wife, the Queen of Saxony. That hissing noise is his calling. You can tell he's getting particularly excited because he's erected the black feathers on his shoulders into a cape, another of those transformation tricks that seem to be a speciality of this family.

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.

PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5.

These baby woodpeckers fell to the ground when the rotten tree that their nest was in was pushed over. In this miraculous story of compassion, Captain Quinn saves the baby birds.\nTranscript: Captain Quinn here. Saving baby birds. Yeah, that's right. Woodpecker, to be exact. Baby woodpeckers. Flickers, to be even more specific. So about a week ago, I was building this chicken coop here, which happens to be crookeder than a witch's nose, but we won't get hung up on that. The chickens don't care. And I noticed this rotten old birch tree, and it was a complete safety hazard. So I pushed it over with my muscles, and when it hit the ground, it exploded right in the center. And I heard, squawk, squawk, squawk! And I looked, and there were seven baby woodpeckers. So I felt terrible, decided I had to do something. You know, like, they have just as much a right to be here as I do. So I gathered them all up in my warm embrace, put them in a shoebox, kept them warm in a dark place, and then did a little research, called an animal rescue helpline, and found out that I can either feed them a diluted mixture of cat food and plain yogurt every half an hour. Well, that's not going to happen. Or I can drive them the two and a half hours to the closest animal rescue shelter. That's also not going to happen. Or, their best chance at survival is to actually put them back in their nest, and put that nest back to where it originally was, so the parents can find them. You see, birds have a very poor sense of smell, but they have a very, very strong bond between the parents and the offspring, just like every other animal, which is pretty powerful, a bond that can't be broken easily. So I decided to reconstruct their nest, put them back in, hoist them back up to roughly the same spot, and see if the parents would come back. The problem was, the nest was in shatters, about 50 different pieces. But, I'm a crafty man, so I grabbed all the pieces, a few screws, hammered the screws into the old rotten tree, and duct taped around it with this clear duct tape, packing tape I think, and put the little critters back in, and tied a rope around the top of the rotten snag, and hoisted her back up, and waited. 15 minutes later, to my delight, one of the parents came back, and went right back in the little hole, and fed their little, you know, their offspring, the little babies. I've been observing these birds for about a week now, and it's pretty magnificent. About every 10 to 20 minutes, one of the parents, the mom or the dad, come back with food. They feed the little youngsters, and then they clean up the nest. They fly out, they're busy, they're at it all day. And it's been very cool getting to watch that. Pretty exciting. And they don't mind having chickens as neighbors, and they don't mind me as a spectator. So, it's been pretty cool. And it's been about a week. They've feathered up, and I check on them every day. They come over here to their home, and I, you know, I just tell them, you know, how are you guys doing? And as you can hear, they're quite little chatterboxes. There's a little hole in here I left so I could peek on them, see how they're doing. They're getting feathers. How are you guys doing? When are you planning on leaving the nest? Huh? Huh? About that time, I think. Oh, hi! I'm now, for scientific purposes, so we can get a better understanding of what exactly goes down in a woodpecker's nest, going to stick the pecker cam down inside Woody Woodpecker's hole. No, this is not a colonoscopy. See, woodpeckers, unlike other birds, have their nests inside hollow, rotten trees. I think, I'm not exactly sure what their plan is here. I don't know if they're going to peck their way out of there or climb up and jump. I'm not sure, but I'll keep you posted on that. But I just thought that, you know, if I can save a baby bird, then so can you. And sometimes, as we are being human and doing human things, we put the lives of animals at risk, and I think that we need to remember that they have a right to be here, just as much, if not more so, than us. So if we do find ourselves in a position where we have jeopardized the life of another living animal, I think we should do everything we can to save it and protect it. I'm Captain Quinn, and that's how to save a baby bird. See you next time. Don't forget to subscribe and tell your friends.\nComment: At 4:24 I love how they all stop for a second and stare at the camera like \"Crap what is that?!\" And then there like \"Oh it's just a pecker cam\" and continue on yapping.. gets me every time!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5.

Service information and feedback: \nTranscript: The differences are only in the animals themselves, their strategies and their settings. In the sky, there's no place for a stalking predator to hide. So for the element of surprise, the peregrine falcon has to resort to sheer speed. In a dive, it's the fastest bird in the world. So fast, it's breathtaking. It stalks by flying high and relying on eyes that are as good as telescopes. The fat, slow-looking pigeon might seem to be doomed, but it evolved as peregrines evolved and is equipped to watch for them. Eyes on the side of its head Eyes on the side of its head enable the pigeon to forage for seed and scan the sky at the same time. It spies the peregrine. And once it's in the air, it becomes a racer. The peregrine, lightness, streamlining, speed. The pigeon, strength, endurance, enough speed. And a head start. The peregrine is more manoeuvrable. The pigeon has a wider field of vision and plenty of manoeuvres of its own. It's also flying for its life. This time, the pigeon outflies its pursuer. This peregrine is still young and just learning that she can fly. But speed by itself isn't always enough. It must race its game.\nComment: I am from the Azores islands and have had pigeons all my life. We do not have falcons there. Have been living in California for 45 years and have had 13 different breeds of pigeons. The ones I have that have been able to escape a falcon,  not all the times, is a cross breed. I have crossed a Turkish Kelebek with a Birmingham roller and a Portuguese tumbler. I call it Portuguese rollerbecks. They summersault, dive, zig-zag but still once in a while they are a meal for the peregrine falcon. The escampadissa pigeon from the island of Majorca, to my knowledge, is the only pigeon that can outsmart a falcon, but again not all the times."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The rut continues right here on Bowhunt or Die!\nTranscript: Bowhunter Dye is being brought to you by Matthews, Lost Camo, New Archery Products, J.B. Tinks, Lone Wolf Portable Tree Stands, Scent Blocker, Campbell Cameras, and Stealth Cam. Welcome to another action-packed episode of Bowhunter Dye. I'm Justin Zarr and alongside me as always is Todd Graff. You know, Todd, we've got two more really exciting buck hunts to share with our audience this week. We do. You know, it's been a great year. I've been fortunate enough to harvest my second buck here in Illinois. It's a buck's name is Captain Hook. It turned out to be quite the adventure on the recovery but it did work out okay in the end. Yeah, you know, I actually got to play a little part in that recovery but, you know, last week we talked about backing out after an unsure hit which is what you did and actually the other buck that we're going to feature this week which came from Dean Krieger, kind of the same scenario. He was a little bit unsure of the hit so he backed out and, you know, fortunately was able to recover his buck the next day. Right, you know, it's difficult to pull out. It makes really for a sick sleeping evening but in the end it is the smartest thing to do. Well, let's jump right in a tree with Todd on his hunt for Captain Hook. Beautiful buck. I don't know if he went down over there or not, guys. I made a nice Tony Vineyard shot. It looked to me to be a good shot. Oh, he popped right out of this corn. Scared those two smaller bucks away. I'm gonna have to re-watch the footage. I don't know how good of a shot I made or didn't make. I mean, it looked like it wasn't bad but he just didn't act the way I wanted him to act. I may have only got one lung. Let's get out of here. I've learned from experience when you find yourself in situations you just gotta back out, be calm, don't disturb the area. Hopefully he will not go far and he'll expire. Well, the Calvary has arrived. Mike and Justin just showed up. They're not hunting that far away from here so luckily they were able to come give me a hand. You know, that buck came in and I blew it. There's no question about it. I could have been a little bit more calm and I shouldn't have punched the trigger like the way I did. That buck was totally calm. I should have just gave him two more steps and I would have probably had a much better broadside double lung shot but you know what? We did all the stuff right. We pulled out. It's been over four and a half hours now so we're gonna go over at the point of impact, see if we can find my arrow. I'm pretty positive it was a pass through. We've watched the footage over and over and over. He went about 30-40 yards and just stood there for a while so let's see what we can find. I'm hoping that this buck didn't go too far. Let's take a look. We got some blood right here guys. I mean there hasn't been a lot of blood but we're still on the trail so that definitely makes me feel better. We just jumped him. That's not a good sign. That's enough to make you sick right there guys. Wait until tomorrow on this one. I'm here with my friend Scott Hill. He's my neighbor. You know what? It's so great when you got good neighbors when you own hunting property. There's nothing better and more valuable than a good neighbor. Scott was nice enough to, actually he was super nice. He left his wife go hunting this morning and he came out here and helped me track. You know, he went about another 100 yards. We found about four more beds. We just came up around the hill over here and there he is. He's laying right over there. He must have just went up the hill and then came back down. Oh my gosh guys. What an awesome looking deer. Come on take a look at this buck. It's November 7th. You know what? I found my buck, thank goodness, this morning. I shot him yesterday morning. I had great footage. You know, the buck came right in. Unfortunately, I made a mistake. I should have gave that buck at least a couple more seconds and he probably would have turned broadside to me. He's a good four and a half year old. Nice brown horns, heavy mass. He's got this really unique right side. There's nothing better than shooting a freak buck. I can't wait to check my stealth cams out. I'm hoping I got a couple videos up because this is really a good looking buck. He's just a good heavy horn. Nice looking buck. I am extremely happy. I am tagged out in Illinois. I'm going to head now to Wisconsin. I've got two tags left in Wisconsin. I'm going to head up there and see what I can get done in Wisconsin.

The 800,000-acre Twin Peaks Herd Management Area lies along the California-Nevada border northeast of Susanville.\nTranscript: Hi, I'm standing in the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area in Northern California. This is the largest wild horse and burrow management area in BLM California. This summer we're planning a gather to bring in excess horses and burrows because we have too many on the range right now and it's not healthy for either the horses, the burrows or the range that they live on. We manage for a lot of uses out here. Horses and burrows are one of them, as well as cattle and public recreation. So it's important to make sure that we balance all of these uses and make sure that we're taking care of the land we're charged to manage. Today we're going to take you around and show you some of the herd management area. We'll show you some of the areas where the horses and the burrows like to live, where they range, what they eat. We might even be able to see horses and burrows today, that's our plan. Straddling the Nevada-California border about 120 miles north of Reno, Nevada, this rugged high desert landscape provides important habitat for wild horses and burrows and wildlife. It also provides forage for domestic livestock grazing that is an important part of local economies. The appropriate management level for the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area is 448 to 758 wild horses and 72 to 116 wild burrows. The current populations are estimated at 2,300 wild horses, about five times the appropriate management level, and 280 wild burrows, about two times the appropriate management level. At almost 800,000 acres, the region is vast, but its resources limited. In fact, many parts of this rugged-looking landscape are fragile and require careful management. We're standing here on the edge of the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area. I wanted to show you the perennial grasses that are out here and explain a little bit as to why they're important. So before me is some crested wheatgrass and you'll see that it's critical. It's good forage for wild horses and burrows. It also serves as thermal cover for a lot of the smaller species that we have, birds and lizards and things like that. It serves also a purpose of keeping the soil in place. It helps to bind the soil particles together through the root system and also shield the soil particles from raindrop impact. In this part of the HMA, things are higher in elevation, so we end up with more production. These perennial grasses that you see behind me are plentiful and can provide more forage per acre, whereas other parts of the HMA are lower elevation and you end up with approximately 30 acres per one horse a month. We'll show you that a little later when we get to one of those spots. So here we are in the lower elevation area of the Twin Peaks HMA, and while it certainly is beautiful, looks can be deceiving. This area here would take about 30 football fields, or 30 acres, to support one horse per month. It comes out to be a lot of country when you consider we want about 500 horses in the HMA. There are other uses out here as well, such as pronghorn, mule deer, and permitted livestock grazing. The horses and burros are healthy, and much of the range appears to be healthy as well. A closer look, however, reveals that some areas are showing signs of stress, requiring management actions, including reducing the wild horse herd. Limited water and the need to keep water sources healthy are the primary management concerns in Twin Peaks. So we're at Painter Creek now, and this is an area that we would call functioning at risk during our riparian assessments. Some of the indicators here as to why things are not properly functioning. You can see the slough banks here. This is due to trampling from livestock and horses when they come down in. If the right type of riparian vegetation isn't here, and the root system isn't stable enough to hold the soil in place, you'll actually get it sloughing off, destabilizing the banks, and then also causing a decrease in water quality. So there are several reasons why we want to keep riparian areas from becoming this degraded, and why we want to see them in proper functioning condition and not functioning at risk. That includes for the health of the wildlife that use the area, as well as the health of the Twin Peaks horse herd. It's important to keep this water system available and functioning year-round, since water is such a limiting factor in these arid environments. So this is an example of a properly functioning riparian area. Some of the indicators that you would look for would be riparian species covering the banks, which is what you see here, aquatic vegetation throughout the stream channel, clear water that can support wildlife, such as the fish and the minnows that you see in the creek behind us, as well as stabilized makes. Visited during spring, much of the Twin Peaks area appears vibrant and green, but this situation changes over the course of the summer. Hot weather and the lack of rain reduce the amount of forage available for range animals, including wild horses and burros. To keep ranges healthy, the BLM must balance uses at sustainable levels. Livestock are managed in specific areas and allowed on the range for designated grazing seasons. In response to resource conditions, the BLM and ranchers have reduced livestock numbers by about 50% compared to 30 years ago. Wild horses and burros use the range all year, therefore, herd populations must be maintained at sustainable levels. Balancing uses is part of the BLM's multiple-use mandate and responsibility on the public lands. Wild horses are an integral part and an important part of that diversity that's found out on the ranges. However, if their numbers are allowed to increase without management, then eventually it will come to damage not only the resources and the other uses on the ranges, but the wild horses themselves. Twin Peaks has always had the ability to carry some horses. When numbers get very, very high, you can really run into problems. What in effect happens is that more animals end up being at risk and there can be a set up for catastrophic losses, either from a long-term drought or heavy snow. You know, we're proud of the fact that we have healthy wild horses and burros on the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area. It's important to us to be proactive and make sure that we keep the horses and burros within an appropriate management level. Therefore, we come out and every few years we have to remove the excess horses and burros, and that helps us ensure that the horses and burros remain healthy, as well as the rangelands that they like to roam on. The wild horses and burros that we remove off the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area all go to good homes. Some of them are adopted out, they're very popular for their size and their health, and some of them go to long-term pastures. It's important to BLM that these wild horses and burros do end up in good homes or in the long-term pastures where they can spend the rest of their lives. As public land managers, our job is to manage wild horses and burros on the range, to keep both the horses and burros healthy, as well as the rangelands. And we welcome and encourage your involvement in that work. It takes all of us together to make sure that we're doing the right thing by the horses and the burros and the land.\nComment: What you do not understand is this is a desert, snow covered in winter, dry in the summer with sparse grass, and very little rain.  The way we pay for some of these horses to be provided for ( I.E. they are fed hay in the winter when the ground is covered with snow) is to range cattle on those grounds as well. I have worked in these areas, and you can tell that the horses could use extra groceries"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

This footage was shot at beautiful Animal Kingdom (Disney) in Orlando, Fl.\nTranscript: The large flying fox is one of the biggest bats in the world. Even though it may weigh, on average, only two pounds, its wingspan can get to around six feet wide. That is one of the reasons this bat belongs to the suborder, megabat. Or as I say, the suborder, MEGABAT! These large bats are just one of many species of flying fox. They get their name due to their heads, which up close, sort of look like a fox with their pointed ears. These large flying fox come from the islands of Southeast Asia. They will roost high up in the trees and they will become active at sunrise and at sunset. So they aren't strictly nocturnal. And since they're considered an old world bat, they also can't echolocate like some other bats can. So they rely on their sense of smell and strong eyesight to locate food. Food for these large bats is pollen, leaves, flowers, and fruits. So you don't have to worry, they're not going to suck your blood. They play an important role where they can take fruit seeds from one island to another to help the fruits grow in new locations. Now unfortunately, they are often seen as pests since they eat flowers and they then are over hunted. These large flying foxes also need a lot of trees and in Southeast Asia, a lot of forests and jungles are being cut down due to the growing human population and a need for more space. The flying fox will usually give birth to just one pup so it's very important to conserve each and every large bat we see. Their young will stay with them for around 12 to 14 weeks and then they become mature enough to go out on their own. For more information on the flying fox, please read this video's description below. And as always, thanks for watching!\nComment: yup, i would rather see one of these flying around then a field of flowers :) I am sure they never eat all the flowers, but people freak out over nature too much."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

For more information go to \nTranscript: This is a barn owl. Wow, it's such a beautiful bird. Look at some of its amazing adaptations. It's got this incredible heart-shaped face. Now the facial disc actually gathers sound in the same way as your ears do. The ears are actually just behind the eyes within the feathers, which are really hard to see. And when it's hunting, it can actually hear the sounds of small mammals on the ground below, which is incredible. Its flight is very, very quiet, partly because the feathers are so soft and the body is so light, it passes through the air really, really gently. The legs are really, really long, which is an adaptation for diving into long grass and catching the small mammals which they feed on. The eyesight is amazing as well. Barn owls are able to detect movement when there's hardly any light. It's just such an incredible bird. But unfortunately, there are some problems with the barn owl because of these specialisations. Adapted for hunting from the air, it has to be very light. Barn owls can't put on a lot of fat to help them get through the winter. And also, its feathers, which are so soft and not particularly waterproof, so a barn owl can't hunt during the rain. And so the weather has an effect, food shortage has an effect, and numbers of barn owls go up and down tremendously in response to these environmental changes. It's a sad fact that barn owls have declined tremendously, particularly since World War II. The landscape upon which we all depend has changed tremendously. And barn owls have declined because of a reduction in food supply, because of intensive agriculture, loss of hedgerows, loss of old pasture, loss of the rough grassland with all those small mammals in it. Unfortunately, they're prone to accidental deaths. They die from flying into things like motor vehicles on motorways. And a lot of barn owls starve to death because of a lack of food. So the numbers have gone down by at least 70% since the 1930s, which is something we're really trying to address. Because of their rarity, barn owls are afforded special legal protection. They're not only protected against being killed, as are most wild birds, but they're also protected against disturbance whilst they're nesting. Barn owls are also known as an indicator species. If there are barn owls, plenty of them, in the environment, then that's an indication that actually the food chain is really healthy. There's lots of nice, rough habitat supporting lots of small mammals, supporting barn owls. And if you have that habitat, of course, there's so much other biodiversity which will be supported by it. To find out more, why not explore the website?\nComment: All Barn Owls use both methods of eating - usually they swallow small mammals whole, but sometimes they tear the prey to pieces, and this is how they feed their young. In this case, the mother Barn Owl may be protecting the eggs which could suddenly get jolted if she throws her head back to swallow the prey. When the eggs hatch she will be feeding the owlets with small pieces of prey - so it may also be that this behaviour is beginning to kick in already - even before her eggs have hatched."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

These forests are home to diverse fauna and flora, many of them showing affinities to the Malayan region, but are increasingly threatened by human activity. Several national parks and other protected areas lie within the range, but it is estimated that only a small fraction of the Western Ghats remains in pristine condition. The Silent Valley National Park in Kerala is considered by many to be the last tracts of virgin tropical evergreen forest in India.Biogeographers have long recognized the distinctive plant and animal communities of the Western Ghats. Many of these faunal and floral elements are not found anywhere else in India except in parts of northeastern India. The Western Ghats are also home to many endemic species, and the endemism is especially high in the amphibian and reptilian fauna.\nTranscript: so so so so so ah uh so hmm so so so so so so so\nComment: Excellent video.

I can already hear the birds in the background and I hear they've got a few of these babies as well. So I'm excited. Let's go check it out. The Wildlife Sanctuary was built in 1975 to protect rare Arabian species such as the Oryx, Adex and Reem gazelle. Now the park has over 1,000 species of animals including exotic birds, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas and even a few giraffes. Visitors to the park pay about 1 dinar for a tour and overview of the facilities. The tour includes a short video of the wildlife in the area and a bus ride through the reserve. So we're at the carnivorous complex now. Could you tell us about the animals that live here? We have here the Arabian leopard. This Arabian leopard is a very dangerous species and we have also the Arabian wolf. He is endangered and the caracal is a very endangered species and cheetah also. We're going into the cheetah cage right now. I'm just a little bit nervous. Oh, more birds. Don't, don't tease me. Don't tease me. Don't tease me. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. I want to touch it now. Okay, you touch, no problem. It is okay, I know. Oh, look at me, look at me. Look at me. Catering to visitors and residents alike, the Al Horeen Wildlife Park is a must-see experience for the animal enthusiasts. The park is perfect for families and animal lovers to explore at leisure.

This footage was shot at beautiful Animal Kingdom (Disney) in Orlando, Fl.\nTranscript: The large flying fox is one of the biggest bats in the world. Even though it may weigh, on average, only two pounds, its wingspan can get to around six feet wide. That is one of the reasons this bat belongs to the suborder, megabat. Or as I say, the suborder, MEGABAT! These large bats are just one of many species of flying fox. They get their name due to their heads, which up close, sort of look like a fox with their pointed ears. These large flying fox come from the islands of Southeast Asia. They will roost high up in the trees and they will become active at sunrise and at sunset. So they aren't strictly nocturnal. And since they're considered an old world bat, they also can't echolocate like some other bats can. So they rely on their sense of smell and strong eyesight to locate food. Food for these large bats is pollen, leaves, flowers, and fruits. So you don't have to worry, they're not going to suck your blood. They play an important role where they can take fruit seeds from one island to another to help the fruits grow in new locations. Now unfortunately, they are often seen as pests since they eat flowers and they then are over hunted. These large flying foxes also need a lot of trees and in Southeast Asia, a lot of forests and jungles are being cut down due to the growing human population and a need for more space. The flying fox will usually give birth to just one pup so it's very important to conserve each and every large bat we see. Their young will stay with them for around 12 to 14 weeks and then they become mature enough to go out on their own. For more information on the flying fox, please read this video's description below. And as always, thanks for watching!\nComment: Great animals! Sadly they are being killed in Australia due to human settlement, and the fear of another outbreak of the Hendra virus that they are known carriers of. Personally I think there's no risk of these guys ever becoming extinct, if you see the huge colonies of them in remote parts of northern Australia, you'd understand why. They are also a delicacy in South-East Asia, Northern Australia, Papua New Guinea and the other parts of the South Pacific.  "},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: I agree with you.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Yes, we can.

They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity.

There were a few notices put up by the hotel indicating that wild animals are not to be fed. Since this squirrel looked rather tame and more familiar with the surroundings I thought of giving it a banana :) May be it was used to the hotel guests feeding it. I was very close and was able to admire it while it was feeding itself. The surrounding of the resort hotel chalet where we stayed was rather interior and was bordering a Wildlife Sanctuary. Grizzled Giant Squirrel - (Ratufa Macroura) ================================= The grizzled giant squirrel is a large tree squirrel found in the highlands of Sri Lanka and India. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as near threatened due to habitat loss and hunting. Countries - Native - India , Sri Lanka Taxonomic Notes - There are three very distinct subspecies, with one present in India and all three present in Sri Lanka. Red List Category & Criteria - Near Threatened Justification - Listed as Near Threatened because this species is probably in significant decline due to habitat loss and hunting throughout much of its range. Range Description - This species is endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. In India it is known from only five severely fragmented locations, while it occurs more widely and less fragmented in Sri Lanka. Population - The Indian population has been estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals, and the population has been decling due to habitat loss and hunting The population of this species is considerably higher in Sri Lanka. Habitat and Ecology - It is a diurnal and arboreal species. It occurs in tropical dry deciduous and montane forests, where it is confined to the riverine habitats. It has a generation time of ~7-8 years. Major Threats- Habitat loss and degradation due to agro-industry farming, small-scale logging, selective logging, increase in human settlements, forest fire, inter-specific competition, competition from alien species, hunting for local consumption purposes, presence of domestic predators have been observed to be the major threats for this species. The grizzled giant squirrel's common name came from the grey to brown colouration highlighted with white at the top of the tail, giving it a grizzled appearance. The rest of the body varies in colour geographically and may be brown, red, grey or black, but the fur on the underside is always lighter than the back. This agile climber is adapted for life spent almost entirely in the trees, and has a very long tail for balance, broad hands for climbing and large claws for gripping branches. The ears are short, round and sometimes tufted.Music By Lohstana David from Jamendo .com\nTranscript: \nComment: @Jawa2lak Yes Jawa,These Squirrels loves to eat fruits.I think their favourites were Mangoes and Bananas.\nI am always happy to see your wonderful words and kind response .Immense thanks for you :)\nBlessings for you !!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The cats' efforts were captured by high-definition and slow-motion cameras for the Saving a Species series for teachers.Subscribe to our channel on YouTube:  to our print magazine:  our Blog:  us on Twitter:  a fan on Facebook:  our TV show: \nTranscript: Today we're shooting an episode of Shamu TV. It's a television show that we develop for schools all around the country. We've been developing this show for 20 years now and today we're teaching kids all about cheetahs and the conservation behind them. We're here at Tropicana Field today to showcase the speed of the cheetah on a football field. Even though we have an awesome habitat at Bush Gardens, 100 yards football field will give us the opportunity to showcase what that speed looks like on a field that people can relate to. This whole stadium is locked down today. I've got bunches of trainers with me so that we can keep track of everything. We made sure that we ran the cheetahs multiple times on the lure so that they got used to the lure and we actually brought them out here to get them comfortable with the facility. We brought them out today, we knew everything was in order and all we needed to do was let that lure fly and let them do what they do best. Today we shot all of the footage both with regular high definition cameras but we also shot everything in high speed cameras. That allows us to really slow down the motion of the cheetah and you can get a chance to see things that you would never be able to see with the naked eye. We got our cheetahs up to about 46, 47 miles an hour today. They can get up to 60 miles an hour. It's very fast for a human to get up to 24 miles an hour but that's nothing for a cheetah. They did awesome. Every one of them ran faster each time. They were engaged. They didn't care about the lights and it was really great to see what they can do in a new environment. They were great. Well, you know, kids love animals. What we hope that they'll learn is that cheetahs are an endangered species, they need protection and that they also have an opportunity to help. Finding out how they can learn more about cheetahs, helping to protect them through the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the SeaWorld and Bush Gardens Conservation Fund and also learning about the animals that are in their own backyard, many of which also need protection. It's just something that we've been doing for a long time.

That may mean habitat loss for local animals.  Now, a strip of woods near HSUS headquarters is being developed.

Really large equipment is going to come and knock these trees down and it's going to be a real upheaval. A property near the headquarters of the Humane Society of the United States will soon be filled with pavement. The road is going to come right through here along this fence line and it's going to go right along these burrow sites. Earth movers are breaking ground, putting many animals, including groundhogs and fox, in harm's way. They wouldn't make it. Fox and groundhogs would likely not make it. The animals would get buried alive, especially since this is ground zero. We know this is where the road is coming through, so we know this area is going to be completely altered. And most of it is going to be gone. So many animals are being relocated. The trapping effort is sort of the last ditch effort to get the remaining animals out of the burrow systems. Take this groundhog brought to a new home miles away. But here she'll be safe. And HSU's staff is stepping in to make sure others survive the habitat loss. I'm fortunate that these animals have been living here for countless years and are going to be losing their homes, so I want to just dedicate a little bit of my time to try to help them and save their lives ultimately. It's sort of, I guess, representative of what's happening across America with increasing development and urban sprawl and so forth. Got him. Got him? Yeah. The more people, the better, because the more ground we can cover, the more intensely we can sweep, and the likelihood, you know, of finding more animals and getting them off the site to save them improves. Destroyed. But it's hard to see them, real hard to see. With some encouragement, many animals did move on their own. Now an entirely new home awaits, and hopefully soon enough, this will feel like home.

The sanctuary is a permanent home to over 100 rescued big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards. As well as smaller species like bobcats, servals, and sand cats. Campers arrive every day and get to explore our 55 acre property, making sure they say hello to the cats and taking lots of photos along the way. While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this. We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life. Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans. They get to do lots of fun activities, like making Big Cat popsicles and learning about our operant conditioning program and why it's so important to the cats at the sanctuary. Then campers observe Big Cat keepers handing out the popsicles they made and the cats willingly participating in our operant conditioning program.

Hence, my observation and reasoning is that the evolution path of of humans progressed successfully, whereas the evolutionary path of carnivorous animals became outdated! It's a bit like with the lifestyle of murderers, because they too apply a lifestyle of morbid tactics in order to satisfy their perverse desires.\nIm Brehms Tierleben I read that leopard enjoy falling into a blood rush...killing up to forty sheep only licking their blood without eating a bit of their flesh. The very same \"blood-rush\" behavior enjoy hyenas, by crushing the sculls of as many baby seal they encounter and then abandoning them.\nWorst of all, many carnivorous animals now dismember their victims alive, for now they evolved into talented assassins!  Since their cruelty is unlimited, how can any animal-conservationist/ -lover support this type of behavior?\nI don't know about you, but to me that says a lot about the evolution of carnivorous animals has gone wrong!! - Since their evolution misled them to virtually enjoy this morbid lifestyle, we (higher evolved species) are entitled to treat them, like we treat our mentally handicapped criminals, by locking them up in a safe, comfortable enclosure, such as zoos and parks, offering them veterinary care and security, where they won't harm anyone anymore. - There they live peacefully and longer, too (like me!) and are fed humanely slaughtered meat or meat of died animals.\nFor Millenniums the lifestyle of wild animals was correct, under the given conditions. Also, our human caveman mentality of hunters & gatherers was right, too.\nThe problem is that now the world has changed, rendering the lifestyle of wild animals increasingly unsustainable, because humans won the evolution race and need more space and natural resources.\nSince the evolution of wild animals is unable to adapt to present conditions, we are the only specie able to help them to do so. - Thus now for animals it's a matter of change/ adapt or be changed!  I.e. they need to reduce their numbers to a sustainable level, which secures their survival and we offer them veterinary care and zoological gardens, where they live happier and longer. Our Labs are able to create antibiotics to save human lives and rescue wild animals. So, I suggest  not to rely on wild animals to rescue us, for they only enjoy torturing and devouring us piece by piece alive and then viruses finish them up, too. Feel free to ignore my insight and join the ranks of animal conservationists, who prefer to foster and perpetuate intolerable animal suffering. Incidentally, Isis fosters the same mentality...?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

And home to the Saltwater Crocodile. Abundant cattle and birdlife can be seen along its shores. And this provides an excellent food source for the Saltwater Crocodile. Crocodiles in this area are some of the largest seen anywhere in the world. With an estimated 20 crocodiles per kilometre of river, this truly is the land of the giants. Fights break out often in the crocodile world, usually for the best spot. Here it is in slow motion. Watch for the snap. Bam! Of course I went there to see the giant crocodiles. Here is a normal sized croc. And here is Maximus. Estimated to be between 6 and 7 metres in length. As you can imagine, he is very good at intimidating his rivals. He is rarely seen on the bank, probably because of his massive size. This area of the Ord River is adjacent to many cattle properties. Seen here is a helicopter doing a survey, possibly checking how many of their cattle are still alive. Often crocodiles are seen grouped together. Here you can see four crocodiles hanging around in the one spot. Recently a local cattle station reported that they lose one to two cows per day to crocodile attacks. And with the sheer numbers of crocodiles I have seen in this area, I have no doubt. This has been Jeremy Rook, crocstalker.com. Thanks for watching. Please subscribe to my channel.

Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five. I'm Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism.\nComment: Thanks for the video !!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Containing 2 recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern Canada to central Mexico, including most of the contiguous United States. The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semi-desert, urban edge, forest edge, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but populations are vulnerable to local extinction by coyotes and domestic animals. With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized genus Lynx. It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about twice as large as the domestic cat. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby (or \"bobbed\") tail, from which it derives its name.Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares, it hunts insects, chickens, geese and other birds, small rodents, and deer. Prey selection depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months.Although bobcats have been hunted extensively by humans, both for sport and fur, their population has proven resilient though declining in some areas. The elusive predator features in Native American mythology and the folklore of European settlers.Tags: Are bobcats dangerous, difference between bobcat and lynx, do bobcats kill people, what does a bobcat look like, what do bobcats eat, can a bobcat be trained, can a bobcat be a pet, can you hunt bobcat, can you eat bobcat, does bobcat taste good, how big are bobcats, bobcat vs lynx, bobcat vs mountain lion, what sound does a bobcat make, do bobcats meow, How to call a bobcat, how to call a coyote, how to call a mountain lion, how to call a cougar, bobcat footage, bobcat hunting, coyote hunting, cougar hunting, mountain lion hunting, predator hunting, predator calling, how to use a mouse squeaker, wild cat footage, wildcat footage, bobcat in the wild, lynx footage, is a bobcat a lynx, is a lynx a bobcat, what’s the difference between a lynx and a bobcat?, bobcat characteristics, bobcat behavior\nTranscript: okay so so so ah so so so so so so are you gonna shoot that\nComment: My dog and I came across a bobcat, and it stopped about 20 feet away from us and turned around and looked, made no aggressive moves towards us so me and the dog just backed away talking to it and left"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

In this highlight, Forsberg describes his mission to catch a bobcat with a camera trap in Nebraska.-----A nature photographer and Nebraska native, Michael Forsberg shares his work documenting this vast landscape, its lakes, prairies along with its plants and animals.The Great Plains are a dynamic but often forgotten landscape -- overlooked, undervalued, misunderstood, and in desperate need of conservation. Forsberg's book helps lead the way forward, informing and inspiring readers to recognize the wild spirit and splendor of this irreplaceable part of the planet. - California Academy of SciencesMichael Forsberg is a Nebraska native and has focused much of his work in North America's Great Plains, once one of the greatest grassland ecosystems on Earth. His goal has been to try to capture the wild spirit that still survives in these wide-open spaces and put a face to the often overlooked native creatures and landscapes found there. His hope is that the images can build appreciation and go to work to inspire conservation efforts on the land far into the future.Forsberg received a degree in geography with an emphasis in environmental studies from the University of Nebraska, and worked briefly as a seasonal ranger in the National Park Service before accepting a job as a staff photographer and writer producing natural history stories for NEBRASKAland Magazine, the state's conservation publication. He worked at the magazine for six years before starting his own photography business and gallery.Forsberg's work has appeared in publications including Audubon, National Geographic, National Wildlife, and Natural History, and recognized in the Pictures of the Year and Wildlife Photographer of the Year competitions. In 2001, his image of a Nebraska tallgrass prairie was selected for an International Postage Stamp. In 2004, he was awarded a Conservation Education Award from The Wildlife Society. Recently, he was featured in the PBS documentary \"Crane Song,\" and was the 2009 recipient of the North American Nature Photographer's Association Mission Award.\nTranscript: For a TV, the world is thinking. For these four years, I tried to photograph predators like wolves, grizzly bears, mountain lions, bison, all these creatures that still just barely exist in certain areas of their range. And we were successful on all those except for a bobcat. So when the field work was all done, I went back home and we had about three or four months to get the book out the door. And somebody called me from a little prairie outside of my hometown in Lincoln, Nebraska and said, we think we've seen a bobcat. You can try to photograph your bobcat here. So what the heck? So I went out and I put this camera trap up along this game trail. Here's the camera in a waterproof housing. Right here is a transmitter and a receiver where an infrared beam is going across this game trail. And here's a little flash. And here's a little flash right here. So if something walks down here and steps over that log, in theory the camera should take a picture, right? For the first two months, this is what I got. Nothing. I don't know if it was the prairie fairies or if it was my friends playing tricks on me or what, but we didn't get any pictures of anything other than just nothing. And then, finally, after the turn of the year, we started to get photographs. Raccoon first. Bunny rabbit. Farmer Jones cat down the road. Farmer Jones dog down the road. Good job, California. I got a call in early March 2009 from my publisher, and they said, Mike, you got to pull the plug. Book's got to go off to print. You're done. I went out to pick up the camera traps. I had two pictures in the last deal. Here's the first one. And then an hour later, and it was really great to end with that photograph because that's the last picture that was made for this book. And it sort of creates the arc in the story for me because the look in that bobcat's eye is that same look that I saw in that burrowing owl's eye maybe 10 years earlier. The other thing was was that after traveling and being gone away from my family for all that time, I took this photograph 15 minutes from my home in a prairie that's been restored.\nComment: Is there some like campaign on YouTube to call all remotely interesting ForaTV videos fake? What is there in that to suggest it's fake? Maybe the camera made a noise or looked interesting and that's why the bobcat looked. Felines are curious and alert and can hear very well so if the camera makes the slightest sound before snapping the picture the cat will look. You people's comments are so useless and unfounded, especially McPrfctday's."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

You can tell the difference between the black and White Rhino due to the shape of their lip. He love's rolling in his mud bath and having a scratch, this beauty regimen also helps protect him from the sun and mosquitoes.

Editor: Lucy Garrick, Graphics: Matt White.\nTranscript: This is our gorgeous white rhino, Kai. Although he may look really big and tough, he's actually as sweet as a puppy dog. Well what Kai does is he's actually got a big mud bath in his enclosure. It's pretty cool. He gets a bit dirty. Sometimes when he has that mud all over him, he loves it if you can just pick it off and scratch. It just kind of feels like a massage. They have that mud on their back to help them as like a sunscreen and a mosquito repellent. They actually can't see really well. But Robert, what can they do? They have really, really good hearing. And what's funny about Kai is if you look just on his ears, he's got those little tufts of fur. Isn't that silly? We're not really sure why he has it. Maybe it's to keep the dust out of his ears. This is the white rhino. And they're different from their cousin, the black rhino, for a few different reasons. Firstly, these guys are grazers. So if you look at their mouth, they have that real rectangular shape and really big squishy lips. That's because they eat things like grass. But if you compare them to their cousin, the black rhino, they have a more triangular shaped mouth, don't they? Yeah. It's really pointy. And do you know why they have that? That's because they eat different foods. It's true. So they eat more like things like shrubs. Yeah, so rhinos can actually grow up to be two tons. They're really, really heavy. It's true. Now, the poor rhinos are in a lot of trouble. They're actually critically endangered because of that gorgeous horn. That horn is made out of keratin, which is the same as our fingernails. What people do is they'll kill the rhinos for that horn to turn it into traditional medicine. The biggest thing to protect rhinos or any wildlife is to never, ever buy wildlife products. Kai is one of our biggest animals here at Australia Zoo. But we have lots more, both big and small. So make sure you tune in next time. Yeah, and remember to subscribe to the Pet Collective channel.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: I can't believe this...This is so sad...And I love animals and love tigers and other big cats. :( The least I can do for you guys is to Share this video on facebook so everyone can see it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Finally breaking the camera out again and decided to walk some land in search of sheds, enjoy!\nTranscript: Hey guys, what's up? It's Champlea7. I know I haven't made a video in a super long time, but my camera is actually out of commission right now. I left it at my buddy's house and I haven't seen him for about two months. I went on a hog hunt with him, so I'm using my buddy, the Texas Bone Hunters video camera. And I'm back here on a wildlife management area today near my house in Dallas, Texas. It's about 15 minutes from my house and there's got to be a couple thousand acres back here I'm thinking. I mean, there is just a ton of land to come in here and I mean, I'm kind of just trail hopping right now. I'm doing a shed hunting video today. It's January the 27th or the 28th, one of the two days, Saturday, but I'm back here ready to find some sheds, hopefully bring you guys a quality video, so stay tuned. Well, guys, I know you're probably watching this video to get a couple of shed hunting information from me, so I'm going to share some with you right now, guys. First thing, this is a really new area to me. I really haven't come back here a lot. I've come back here to do a little bit of bow fishing. You might have seen some of my bow fishing videos, but I noticed a lot of the land that was back from where I bow fish is a wildlife management area, so that's why I'm in here today. This is really my first time in here and what you want to do, you really want to pick apart your cover whenever you're shed hunting. Look for any sort of geographic region that might hold deer more, like openings within some really heavily wooded forests. Look for a sign. Keep away from those areas that are devoid of signs. Try not to trail hop. I'm really guilty of doing that a lot. I do get lucky sometimes trail hopping, but you could probably find a lot more if you look for a sign. I've got a rub right here in front of me. These deer in Texas actually rut around late December into January, so I know that this is probably kind of fresh and there's some deer hanging around here, but I know a lot of bucks still haven't shed right now, especially here in the Lone Star State because we're so far south. It's really not a hard winter on these deer, so I'm really looking for older sheds maybe. Just anything that might be in here. There's a ton of woods. There's no way someone's covered at all, so I'm going to try to get a couple finds. So stick around. Hey guys, the Texas bone hunter is over here. He's found some bone. Let's see what he's got. He's probably already picked it up here. Man, this is some thick stuff. I can't believe deer are walking through here. Yeah, I know. That is a very nice shed. Was it laying right there? Well, yeah. I mean, it's not even chewed up or anything, dude. Yeah. That's an awesome shed. It's all... Yeah, it's in very good condition. Very good condition. I don't know how long I've been wanting to find a shed for myself, dude, now. Yeah? I'm so pumped. So it was right here, huh? Yeah. Wow. Very nice. Well guys, just found this bad boy right here. Little boar, it looks like. Pretty good cutters on him, actually. This spot of the woods back here is definitely dominated by pigs. You can just tell it's all tore up in here and pigs everywhere. But I found the bottom skull and then found the top skull not even 5 or 10 yards away from it. Pretty easy find and a pretty cool thing to add to my collection. So we're starting to hit some bone here now, whether it be skull or actual sheds. We'll keep in tune, guys, so stay with us. Hey guys, just found my first antler here. I haven't even gone to pick it up yet. I'm going to do an ATL picture of it with my phone and on the camera. But I am excited. It looks really good. I'm about 15 yards away from it right now. So let's go see it. Oh man. Wow, that's a good shed. Ha. Guys, we're on some wildlife management area land here. In Texas. And by God, he's got a split brow. It's pretty nice. A G2 and G3 and he's pretty chunky for being back here. Man. Well, that's awesome. I'm glad we got one, guys. I'm ready to go find some more. Oh my God. Wow. Alright. I ain't kidding you guys right now. I just want to do a walking away shot with this shed. And there's another shed not even laying 10 yards away. Right on the same trail. Looks to be pretty old. So there's some more. Shed's obviously to be found. Keep watching, guys. Wow. Alright, guys. What I'm doing now is what's called gridding. After finding those two antlers, there's a pretty good chance that the other one's going to be pretty close by. So what you want to do is wherever you found that antler, just kind of go back and forth. Help you use landmarks. And trying to find the other side. Basically making a big sweep where you can't miss it. You're not trail hopping. You're doing more of a systematic search. So stay with me. And I'll check in if I get anything. Thanks for watching!\nComment: I was wondering how button bucks shed their antlers if the antlers havent broke thru the skin...\nAnd when are you gonna make another shed vid? im not findin anything so i like to watch the vids and see if other people are finding much or not..

I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It's been built around the base of a sapling, it has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The whole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains, or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss, and on it the shiny wing covers of beetles. There are orange fruit, there are these glowing orange dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits, all of which has been bought specially by the bird. Bowerbirds are so dedicated to their work that even if you sit out in the open beside a bower, they will often continue to work, provided you sit absolutely still. This Vogelkop powerbird is the plainest of his family, with no sign whatever of a crest. But the more spectacular the display in your bower, presumably the less need you have to impress your mate with bright feathers, and it's difficult to imagine a more impressive collection of treasures than this. But they do have to be properly arranged to show them off really well. Flowers, whenever they appear in the forest, have an obvious appeal to a bird who has a passion for interior decoration. From one point of view, these adornments are better than feathers. Individual birds of paradise have no option over the shape and colour of their plumes. They have to display with what their genes have given them. Bowerbirds, however, can choose. If a male decides that he stands a better chance of seducing a female with pink rather than blue, well then he can decorate his bower that way. So it's the tastes and fancies of the females, single mothers who have no need of the help of the male in bringing up their families, that has led to these extravagant exhibitions. Whether or not the bowerbirds are closely related to the birds of paradise, both families have reacted in remarkably similar ways to the asset they share, the huge richness of this forest.\nComment: Bower birds have such incredible making skills. Their discernment, their ;Art, aesthetics, construction, arrangement, collections and beauty. Bower birds can choose. “If a male Bower bird thinks he has more luck seducing with pink he chooses pink flowers”. (He is not at all limited by his plumage alone)."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

While they're out on their mini safaris, they learn about animal behavior, conservation, ecology, and where our cats were rescued from and the issues they're facing in captivity today. Each week, campers work together and make huge enrichment models for the cats of their choice. We lost Vines. We lost Vines. Yay! He's like, I'm going to drown this.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical.

With him I had the privilege of watching and recording a very special moment for this story: dingo pups being born in their lair.It is just one special moment in a story about a farmer who has come up with an unusual way of keeping wild dogs under control on his property.    by Ant On Wax\"Before You Accuse Me\" blues standard performed by Harmonica Rick Gibson soundcloud.com/harmonica-rick-gibson\nTranscript: Australian farmers have a responsibility to control dingoes, or wild dogs, that are running on their property. So about three years ago, I made a decision to change my strategy about controlling wild dogs on my property and decided to go and look for the young at brooding time, which was July. The dingoes have their pups in July. And I was lucky enough to find two litters, and having reared a couple of those dingoes, I got to the understanding that I could probably try a policy of having my own dingo pack and regularly walk them around my property and might be able to control the other of the wild dingo pack by letting them know there was already a pack of dogs in this area. The culmination of my efforts through removing these pups from the hollow logs means that now I have mature dingoes, who are now brooding age, and just only a few nights ago I was very privileged to be present for the birth of my own. I'm right up close and it's all happening just natural like a wood in the bush, except the dingo doesn't have a fear of me and accepts me in. I just feel so privileged to be able to be right up close to something that is normally so secretive. An interesting characteristic I found with dingoes, they don't normally bark, but they have a whole heap of other noises they make in communication, quiet communications, and they do a very throaty, I think a dingo could almost talk. Come up here baby. Yes I will. My lovely dingo baby. Go on. And I learned early on sitting here by the campfire, when I had dingo pups beside me, that when I played the harmonica, they all went into howl. I don't really know whether they think I'm sad or what it is with the harmonica that really gets into them, but all they want to do is come and sit beside me and howl with me. I feed my dingoes a variety of foods. I like to get a big boiler, half fill it with water, put in vegetables. I try to give them as much native food that they would naturally have got themselves. You can't always count on a roadkill kangaroo or something coming along when you need it. They all seem quite happy. I think they do well on it as a matter of fact. I feel privileged to have actually seen what happens with dingoes right up close. They're so misunderstood in Australia. I really realise how much they have accepted me as I'm just one of a number. And I have some very good traits. All dingoes have their part in the pack. I suppose one of my best traits must be they consider me a good cook. Baa! Eee! No! Mm-mm!\nComment: From this video it seems the dingos can be domesticated? Is this true? Could the same wild dog protection be achieved with a domesticated breed such as the Maremma? I applaud your innovative things and trying a new approach to an old problem.

There's baby number four just getting ready. There's the fourth one. It came out and landed on the ground. I'm going to stay here so the cat doesn't get it. That's one chickadee that just about got ate. Apologize for the sound of the lawnmower, but it's pretty neat. Four baby chickadees. This is like the true survival story right here. All these birds never make it because there's just too many cats around here. This is kind of a messed up situation. I'm about four foot away from this bird and I want to leave them alone so that they can go about their natural way, but as soon as I leave, that cat is going to come and eat this bird. It'll get ate if it doesn't get its flying wings. There's their nest in the lower right hand of the screen. I left that one alone. We shooed away the cats, so hopefully the mama can get this little one that was sitting on that metal ring to fly up in the tree with the others, but you can hear them everywhere. And me, I'm running around trying to videotape the baby birds and keep the cats from eating them, which is a bit ironic because I'm a hunter.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: How many species have to go extinct before these hunters and poachers are punished for their crimes!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels. Once again, thanks for watching, stay tuned.\nComment: Like this video no bullshit or glorifying yea high five  crap like a lot of American videos. \nI'm from N,Ireland & I shoot too.

And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: I couldn't click on either the like or dislike buttons.

Service & Feedback \nTranscript: It's early morning, and Mandy is boarding the bus for her regular journey to the training fields. But today, she has a big test ahead to see if she's ready to join an elite team on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique. In the past, dogs have been used for mine detection, but African pouch rats like Mandy have distinct advantages. Rats have some advantages to dogs, that is of course they're smaller in size, they're much cheaper, especially the transport. Our animals which we're using, they're almost blind, or they don't see much, because they're night animals, so they're completely depending on their sense of smell and hearing. And if you look at them, they're sniffing all the time. As with the TB training, Mandy and Chums have spent several months in laboratories, tuning their noses to the smell of TNT, the explosive in landmines. Having completed this stage, they put their nose to the test in the field, on a series of courses designed to stretch their mind-sniffing capabilities. We use three meter, and we call it contamination. Whereby we use iron casings, so we put them down in the field. They are three meter wide, that's why we call them three meter. Then the rat, when it's used with that system, then the rat goes to five meter. The distance from each landmine is much farther, to make the rat work more to find the landmines. They are like humans, some of them they are good, some they are not good. So they're different capabilities. Mandy is one of the rat school's high achievers. Most take about a year to train, but she has made it to the final test in a mere eight months. The rats have to do a few hundred square meters, containing, let's say, five, six, seven mines. And they're not allowed to miss one mine. When they miss one mine, they cannot operate on the minefield. Today, nine real landmines have been hidden. Mandy will have to find them with 100% accuracy. Guided by a search string, which is connected between her two trainers, Mandy moves systematically up and down the course, processing lane by lane. Every time she sniffs a mine, she scratches the surface at the spot. Weighing less than five kilograms, she's too light to set off the explosive device. And when she indicates a mine, she gets what she's in it for. A click, followed by a reward. With nine mines to find, that's a lot of bananas to eat. And as Mandy's ever-expanding pouches show, she's doing rather well. They work for their food, and they work a bit mechanical. Once they know something, they love to repeat it, to repeat it over and over again. So that makes them very well suited for this job. Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana, the test is over. She has passed with flying colours and will head to Mozambique on a mine-clearing mission. The test is over. Mandy's cheeks can take no more banana. The test is over.

I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: Thank you for watching the video and taking the time to post a comment.

It's Great value, well camouflaged, well made, easy to put up and take down, not like the fold away dome hides at all. It's all waterproof and I was using it today in the pouring rain and didn't get wet at all ( though you will if u have the zip part of the windows down as rain gets through the mesh). All in all a very happy purchase, just hope I get some good use from it.\nTranscript: Hello, this is my review of the One Man Photography Chairhide. As you can see it's nice and camouflaged. The one-way lining is velcro strapped. So you can tear that down and have a nice little opening to point your camera out. The front zips down, so you have a nice wide opening if you want a better view. Have a look in the air for any birds of prey. But today I've been using it zipped up like this and it's worked really well. The birds can't see me at all. I've got some nice photographs of some starlings on there and a robin as well. The chairhide's got plenty of room inside. It can be pegged down, comes with a nice carry bag. The backpack fits on your back. It weighs about 5kg, which is quite heavy. But with the backpack sticking on your back it shouldn't be too bad. There's a few windows here. One there, one there. Same on the other side. We've got one-way viewing mesh, so you can see out but they can't see in. And you can velcro them down as well, so you can have the thing completely open if you like. There's also these little covers. They just zip down like that, let you see out. Well, it's one-way but from a distance. If you want to get in, just lift the front up. It's a bit of a faff one-handed, but... Alright, maybe quite a faff one-handed. There you go, you can go the same side. It is a lot easier when you've got two hands to use. It's a nice comfy chair, about the same as you get in a camp stove. Cup holder. Nice inside, easy to put up, easy to take down. Only take you a couple of minutes to put it away. Loads of room inside, you can fit your tripod in. And a camera bag as well. Really nice chair hide, this one's the Stealth Gear one. From Morris Photography for about £75. Really great value. Apart from the weight, which makes it a bit awkward to take with you everywhere you go. But if you set somewhere up, feed a station, it should work a treat. You get some great photos, birds don't even know you're there.\nComment: VERY GOOD!!!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

On 08.03.08, this storm hit the US midsection during a year which already had bad storms. The storm is shown in another video, Great Blizzard 2008, Record Breaking, Storm of Century,  video was made one day afterwards. The wildlife were getting hungry. Here two doe and two fawns come up to the bird feeder (they generally inspect it after dark). Although they were very hungry, they were even more curious about the cat. Deer do not appear to understand what domestic animals are and are exceedingly curious.The cat was curious also. The deer kept their distance, but spent some time looking over the cat. One fawn seemed to not be in the best of a mood. It hit its mother with a hoof at least twice (at ~ .46 and 1.2).The deer kept getting closer to the cat by hiding behind the snow drift, then going back to the tree. The snow was so deep that the deer could hardly run through it, when they left.The previous Video begins with view of field and trees taken immediately (~1-2 days) before the storm. Wildlife includes whitetail deer (which are loosing their antlers), wild turkeys, turkey vultures (sighted here for first time of year), and crows. Video then shows blizzard beginning at night. Nighttime animals out included raccoons (only 1 was photographed) and a coyote. These animals were videotaped in infrared. The  storm was getting bad during the coyote filming. Video then shows view of the storm. Only the closest trees were visible during the whiteout, as compared to the normal view of the area. Small snow whirlwinds, tornados, and gusts traveled across the landscape. Snow was cleared here with backhoe.The record breaking snow fall was 20.4 inches. The previous mark in Ohio for snow during 1 storm was 15.3 inches. And this record was made in 1910. Blizzard was compared to the famous blizzard of 1978. Streets were closed, a snow emergency was declared, and plane travel stopped (although I heard a jet while I was filming the coyote). A level 3 snow emergency was declared in many counties. Freeways were closed. Cities had parking bans. Contingents of several snow plows pulled through, some slid off the road. Many accidents occurred. People intending to vacation in warm places were stuck in Ohio.After the storm traffic was still stopped. The streets were used for sledding and snowboarding.Additional views of wild deer on the farm include:LARGE BUCK FIGHT-LOCK ANTLERS, ENTANGLED, CLOSE WHITETAIL  Non-Typical Moose-Sized Buck DEER - ACTION SHOTS RARE WHITE WILD WHITETAIL BUCK  views of this white deer: white deer on the farm -- the banded one & sibling: white deer being stalked by coyotes: strange deer on the farm deer fighting bucks run and jump bucks fighting COYOTES VS.

A lot of green of flowers to come later in the month or in May. There's another one. I love that flower, but maybe this year I'll pick a new channel icon. And these grape hyacinths are just starting out. There's a lot of them all along the border. This way and all the way around the front. This azalea is going to be a blazing pink. It's going to be great. And here's a few miniature daffodils. Around this tree, this birch tree. Nice daffodils again. Plenty of these around. This is a little tiny, comes from a tiny bulb. Comes back every year. I think I had this tiny, one or two flowers originally a couple years ago. In that spot and it's spreading. Is that one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Another one back here. And another one here that's not open yet. I can't, there it goes. It started out over here and now it's spreading across.

Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.

This video was taken immediately following the charge and shows the aftermath of the mauling that never happened.\nTranscript: Okay, we're on Montague Island out of Port Chalmers and we're hiking up the mountain. We got the coordinates set into the GPS now and we are coming up from the right side up here hiking through the bushes and making noise going out of our way to make some noise. And as we came up we stopped right on the other side of this creek and then up from here we heard the wolf a wolfing sound. So we started making more noise and then we saw a bear charging down at us. She actually stood up on her hind legs by the tree over there and we started making noise. She stood up on her hind legs by the tree and we started making noise and yelling at her. No bear, no bear. And she came running down. She charged to the top of the hill there and then she stopped momentarily. I grabbed my bear spray and she stopped. It was just momentary and then she came on and she came charging at us without without ever without stopping. We had bear spray spraying right into her face and at approximately eight feet I finally I had had my 30-06 actually attached up in my pack. I'd had time to have it out. I got the safety turned off and approximately eight feet away I was on the other side of the ditch right there approximately eight feet away from her. I fired one single shot from my hip and she dropped right there and then we saw two cubs come out up here. They look like spring cubs. She never stopped. She was coming straight at us and we used everything we had starting with the bear spray first and it didn't turn her. What a deer hunting experience. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. Not the way I wanted it to end. Me neither. And it is Sunday September 24th at 12 11. People will second guess us every time you tell this story Shanna. You can see all of the orange bear spray. I emptied a whole can on her and she still kept coming. And unfortunately I don't think she would have quit because we didn't know it at the time but she had two little cubs up there. So bad day for us and for her and for her cubs. Okay you can see right there where she was hit just a little above between the eyes. I mean her head was down. She was coming full bore. I hit her right in the brain. That was a lucky shot for us. Really. Thanks. From the hip. Oh yeah. I mean it was lucky. Especially since you were falling. We need to get some pictures Shanna. We got to get regular photos. Okay. Yeah you can definitely see all the pepper spray on her face. On her fur. On her back even. No bear. Well it took John about um I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well it took John about um an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and a half to get her all skinned out. And so the skin's laying up there beside her. The hide. And then the skull's going to go in there also. So we can take it to fish and game. We haven't seen any other sign of the cubs. Haven't heard them at all. I'm sure they're around.

First released by Captain Cook for a food source for the pioneers of this country, the Feral Pig has thrived in our conditions and multiplied to almost plague proportions. Up here in the territory, the good living has seen the Feral Pig population explode. Cape York is probably the first destination most people think of when they think of pig hunting, but up here in the territory, their numbers are just as strong. I've heard of boars up to around 240 kilos being caught in the territory, but between 80 and 100 kilos is a good sized boar. They are an environmental terrorist, destroying vast tracts of land. In the south, they destroy crops and livestock, decimating the income of our already struggling farmers. Up here in the north, they tear our wetlands and national parks to shreds. No wetland has been left untouched. They act as carriers of weeds and exotic diseases, and they tear up the land until it becomes a mess of impassable pig ruts. Anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of driving across them will know what I mean. With a keen sense of smell, excellent hearing, and razor sharp tusks, pigs can be considered as dangerous game. Wounded animals are especially dangerous, and I've had a few close calls with wounded boars. There seems to be a lot of difference in opinion on what is the best calibre of hunting pigs. My opinion is, if it kills them, use it. I've shot them with everything from a .22 to a .375 Ultramag, but the latter can get quite expensive when you look at how many pigs we have up here. The smaller calibres can have problems penetrating the thick fighting pads and mud on the larger boars, so aiming at the base of the ear is your best bet when shooting with a small calibre. When using the bigger calibres, aiming tight behind the shoulder has always yielded good results for me. Herds of 30 or more are not uncommon. A group of animals this large will destroy a patch of dirt bigger than a football field every single food sitting. The feral pig is a real menace, and we as hunters need to do our part.\nComment: Let's go hunting"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Winter Squirrel Hunting Winter squirrel hunting is a challenging and underutilized sport in Kansas. Check these tips and try it out.\nTranscript: I bought my first 22 when 12 years old, picking up the mail-order treasure and riding it home on my bicycle. For years after that, squirrel hunting was a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound City. It's been a long time since then, but I still enjoy this small-game hunting opportunity. And if you're looking for a challenging way to stretch hunting season, this is it in the Kansas woods. Be warned, wild squirrels are extremely wary, nothing like their city cousins that bask around feeders. If you treat this hunt lightly, you're likely to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities. But if you're patient and stealthy, this basic hunting could renew the good times of youth. It's also a great way to teach young hunters. Squirrel season is open statewide until February 29, so there's plenty of time to get out there. Here are some tips to get you back in the game for this underutilized Kansas hunting. First, look for sign. Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators, and old timber with numerous tree holes provide winter squirrel dens. Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath trees can show favorite feeding places. Winter squirrels also like to eat developing buds. Water is important, and timbered small creeks or seep streams offer perfect habitat. Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential. Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby squirrels to danger. Sneaking in damp conditions helps. Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum. Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait for squirrels is the most effective way. Set up a round feeding habitat and let your eyes do the work. Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter woods, and a hunter is, too. That's why a stationary hunter has the advantage. Especially with squirrels, sole winter tables may help pick the best hunting times. Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable daily schedules that are correlated with sun and moon phases during each month. Check these on the internet, or they are programmed into some watches. Try to hunt the major peak on the day you are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to be active. Squirrel calls can be useful at times. Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished with a bellows-type squirrel call. Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer hunting, but they may not work so well in winter. Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters prefer scope .22s and long-rifle ammunition. Hunting squirrels are hard to hit, so wait for them to stop. Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible to avoid missing or wounding game. Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25 yards or less. Always be certain of your target and what lies beyond it for safety. Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by, provides a challenging hunt, and can lead to tasty eating. Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands, and you'll seldom have competition. As always, get permission before hunting on private ground. Give squirrel hunting a try in this season without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers. The daily limit is five. I'm Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism.\nComment: 25yds or less???

We also have different educational presentations each week where the campers learn about other animals. Talks from our senior veterinarian about how we care for the cats, including flea treatments, sedation techniques, and how we improve their quality of life. Campers also find out how we feed all the cats at Big Cat Rescue. And then actually help prepare the morning meal of fruit and vegetables for our veterans. They get to do lots of fun activities, like making Big Cat popsicles and learning about our operant conditioning program and why it's so important to the cats at the sanctuary. Then campers observe Big Cat keepers handing out the popsicles they made and the cats willingly participating in our operant conditioning program.

They've been a popular symbol of royalty and bravery for thousands of years, in cultures across Europe, Asia and of course Africa. But unfortunately their reign could be coming to an end. Nearly a century ago there were as many as 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, due to illegal killing, habitat loss and fragmentation, the most recent surveys estimate that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild, having vanished from over 80% of their historic range. And because the decline is so rapid, once complete these surveys are often inaccurate and out of date. Lions have slipped under the conservation radar for too long, and if we don't act now, lions will find themselves in the same dire predicament as their Asian counterpart, the tiger. So what's happening to this iconic animal? Human conflict is the number one cause for the decline in lion populations. Lions live in large social groups called prides, sharing territory and regularly hunting together. Their diet mainly consists of wildebeest, antelope, zebra, buffalo and other mammals. So when their habitat is diminished by agricultural activities and people hunt the wild prey beyond sustainability, lions are not only confined to isolated pockets of habitat, increasing their risk of extinction due to lack of genetic diversity, they are also forced to feed on the livestock of farming villagers. To the farmers the cattle are their livelihoods, so they retaliate by hunting and poisoning the lions, establishing a vicious cycle in which lions are left with no alternatives, driving further conflict with humans, in which the lion ultimately loses. The lion is the largest carnivore in Africa. Male lions can grow to over 10 feet in length from the tip of the nose to the tip of their tail, and on average weigh between 4 and 500 pounds. Their roar can be heard for up to 5 miles, and they're second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines. Unfortunately this all makes them a major trophy for hunters, despite their well-documented decline, this so-called sport still continues. And if hunting lions in the wild proves to be too difficult, there are canned hunting operations flourishing in South Africa, where wild animals are shot within a confined area from which they cannot escape. The lions involved are habituated to human contact, hand-reared and bottle-fed, so they're no longer naturally fearful of people. Many tourists often pay to be a part of this cub petting experience, the breeders tell them they're raising orphans for reintroduction, which is a blatant lie. It's true, the cubs are orphans, but that's because their moms are sent to canned hunts, which is where the cubs will go when they're old enough to be shot as well. The end result? Hunters from all over the world are guaranteed an easy kill, sending home lion body parts so taxidermists can preserve their trophy and the hunters can show off their supposed prowess. In America, the crisis is also very real. It's estimated that there are more than 10,000 privately owned big cats. Not only has this led to hundreds of maulings, escapes and deaths of both big cats and humans, the breeders that exploit and sell these animals under the facade of conservation instead fuel the illegal trade in big cat parts. Many restaurants in the US legally serve lion meat on their menus, and the more the market for these parts grows and the more demand grows for the real or premium product, big cats poached from the wild will also suffer. And because lion meat production and sale largely falls through the regulatory cracks, once the animals have been skinned, it's almost impossible to identify the species or origin of the meat, which means risk to human health and also the endangered tiger. To lose the lion in Africa should be considered as our final failure to keep natural populations of large predators alive. Twenty years from now, all natural lion populations, without viable and enforced conservation plans, will be gone. Hunted, poisoned, trapped and slaughtered, new ideas and new ways forward are fundamental to the survival of this amazing species.\nComment: Poor lions!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

The hyenas moo to show affection like a cat purrs.  Then they laugh when getting ready to eat.   They are one of the most intelligent and powerful animas in the world.  Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not. But kind of like a\nComment: It took me a moment to realize it was the hyenas laughing.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: Thank you for your wonderful questions. I'd like to invite you to our main website, BigCatRescue. org which has literally thousands of pages of information.

It's so bad that I hunt, yet I'm trying to save the baby birds from being hunted. Anyway, thanks for watching and thanks for all the comments and support. Talk to you guys later. This is the last one to come out. Oh, is that ever cute. Oh, right on that little thing. Cute. Mama. Uh-uh. Nip, nip, nip, nip. Get her out of there. Go. Hey, little feller.

White Tigers do not exist in the wild, they are purposefully inbred in captivity to meet the demand of the paying public. The kind of severe inbreeding that is required to produce the mutation of a white coat also causes a number of other defects in these big cats. The same gene that causes the white coat causes the optic nerve to be wired to the wrong side of the brain, thus all white tigers are cross eyed, even if their eyes look normal.  They also often suffer from club feet, cleft palates, spinal deformities and defective organs.Read more here:  to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  from APM Music ( and Epidemic Sound ( and Artlist.ioTake action to end big cat abuse at BigCatAct.comShop for cat themed items  YOU!* Music track \"The Pyre\" used courtesy of  you as always for the service you provide :)\nTranscript: White tigers. They captivate us. Ghost-like in appearance, with stunning blue eyes, many think them the most beautiful animals on earth. Mesmerized by their rare beauty, many of us are unaware of what makes a white tiger white, or we think that white tigers are simply Siberian tigers. The truth is, white tigers are white because of a genetic mutation that causes a condition called leucism. Leucistic animals are similar to albino animals in that the pigment in their bodies did not fill in where it should have. Interestingly, leucism in tigers usually occurs among Bengal tigers and not among Siberian tigers at all. There is no place in the world that tigers naturally inhabit where a white coat is helpful. In fact, for a tiger, being white in the wild is a distinct disadvantage. Without the typical orange and black pattern to provide proper camouflage, a tiger cannot depend on the surprise attack to catch its prey. The presence of that orange hue among the black and white stripes is crucial to a tiger survival. For this very reason, no legitimate conservation organization has any plans to release white tigers into the wild. White tigers bred in captivity are bred for a life in captivity. While some may argue that this is acceptable simply because so many of us find white tigers beautiful, we must understand that the only way to get more white tigers is to inbreed them. Mothers are crossed with sons, fathers with daughters, and brothers with sisters. This inbreeding results in a host of health problems, including cleft palates, immune system dysfunctions, neurological disorders, scoliosis of the spine, and blatant deformities that include bulging eyes and teeth that go in all different directions. Captive white tigers must live with these problems, all the while the healthy orange and black tigers in the wild are disappearing at an alarming rate. When we consider these factors, the beauty of white tigers and our fascination with them are not enough reason to continue the practice of breeding them for commercial purposes. Inbred white tigers are traded for thousands of dollars per animal year after year. The public spends thousands every year paying to see them, hold them, and have their pictures made with them. This is proof that among us we have more than enough financial resources to do the real work of conservation, which is preserving the habitat of healthy wild tigers, as well as giving law enforcement what they need to stop people from poaching them. We have the tools. All we need now is the will. The experts say there are 20 years left for tigers in the wild. We can turn this around. With every dollar you spend, every photo you share, every idea you perpetuate, and every bit of goodwill that you have towards animals, choose the path that will lead to a healthy wild population rather than a sick captive population. The tigers and future generations will thank you.\nComment: It seems so.  Thank you for watching and commenting."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Walking around you can gaze upon some of the more amazing animals from around the world. From some of the largest to the downright deadly. Zoos offer the average Joe, and his family, a glimpse into the wonders of the natural world. The zoo can trace its origins back to a more family unfriendly time, to ancient Egypt, when for the pharaoh, owning a hippo zoo was completely normal. It was only into the 19th century when the roaring industrial masses wanted a piece of the action, and science was taking off that the modern zoo was born. And sure, zoos have received bad press in the past, but the modern zoo has been reinvented as a centre of science and conservation. So what are the roles of a modern zoo? Well, roughly speaking, we can divide them into three categories, education, breeding centres, and research. So let's start with education. It's simple really, zoos are a fun and safe place to learn for both kids and adults. The fact is, the animals are real, and you can get up and close to some of the more exotic and threatened creatures from around the world. Every year, 150 million people visit zoos around the world, and it's so important that the next generation is educated and understands the role they play in preserving our planet. Better still, many zoos have education centres with dedicated teams who aim to teach kids about everything from ecosystem services to climate change. Zoos also play an important role as breeding centres. Most zoos these days are part of organisations set up to coordinate breeding programmes and keep standards high. This means your favourite animal like the chimpanzee here is probably part of some national or even international breeding programme. These help zoos maintain genetic diversity and are extremely important for species that are threatened with extinction in the wild. One example is the scimitar-horned oryx. This is a species that became extinct in the wild and only survived in zoos and private collections. It is now part of several international breeding programmes and the hope is one day it will be reintroduced into the wild. And finally, Zoos offer a unique opportunity for biologists. Instead of spending days trying to track down an animal and becoming exhausted in the process, zoos offer a more controlled environment where effective research can be undertaken. Take the devastating disease chytridiomycosis. This has caused dramatic declines and even extinction in at least 200 species of frog. Zoos are actively taking part in research aiming to stop the spread of this disease. Research in zoos contribute to a number of scientific fields including animal behaviour and endocrinology, all ultimately contributing to the conservation of our biodiversity. So sure, a trip to the zoo is a great family day out, but zoos these days aren't there to show off your new hippo. Zoos are centres for conservation, educating the new generation, giving critically endangered species another chance and helping us gather knowledge for the conservation of species and biodiversity.

This footage was shot at beautiful Animal Kingdom (Disney) in Orlando, Fl.\nTranscript: The large flying fox is one of the biggest bats in the world. Even though it may weigh, on average, only two pounds, its wingspan can get to around six feet wide. That is one of the reasons this bat belongs to the suborder, megabat. Or as I say, the suborder, MEGABAT! These large bats are just one of many species of flying fox. They get their name due to their heads, which up close, sort of look like a fox with their pointed ears. These large flying fox come from the islands of Southeast Asia. They will roost high up in the trees and they will become active at sunrise and at sunset. So they aren't strictly nocturnal. And since they're considered an old world bat, they also can't echolocate like some other bats can. So they rely on their sense of smell and strong eyesight to locate food. Food for these large bats is pollen, leaves, flowers, and fruits. So you don't have to worry, they're not going to suck your blood. They play an important role where they can take fruit seeds from one island to another to help the fruits grow in new locations. Now unfortunately, they are often seen as pests since they eat flowers and they then are over hunted. These large flying foxes also need a lot of trees and in Southeast Asia, a lot of forests and jungles are being cut down due to the growing human population and a need for more space. The flying fox will usually give birth to just one pup so it's very important to conserve each and every large bat we see. Their young will stay with them for around 12 to 14 weeks and then they become mature enough to go out on their own. For more information on the flying fox, please read this video's description below. And as always, thanks for watching!\nComment: Our flying foxes here in Queensland, Australia are constantly being dispersed. Sadly people fear them and want them out of their backyards, whereas in fact they have built their homes in the bat's backyards. We try to educate people that we can co-exist with these beautiful creatures but sadly our government don't share our opinions and are allowing country towns permits to disperse them plus they will euthanize the pups in the trees after dispersal which is just heartbreaking!

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Wolves delisted Again 3/06/2009 URGENT Photos courtesy of  those of you who are unaware of this, the new Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar has delisted the wolves in Western Great Lakes and the Rocky Mountain states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Utah as of March 6th, 2009.  Wyoming will be added as soon as some details are worked out.  This means that the lives of 1,000 wolves are now in jeopardy from the ranching and hunting communities.This should come as no surprise if you have visited Ken Salazar's bio page at the Department of the Interior's website where he says that he has been a champion of farmers and ranchers throughout his career.  His family has operated a \"farm\" named El Rancho Salazar for 30 years.  If you know anything about those who raise livestock you are well aware of the war they rage against any and all predators at a cost of $42 million tax dollars a year.  Livestock mortality due to predation (by all predators including bears, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, wolves and birds of prey) constitutes 3%.  Of that 3% predation, wolf kills comprise between 1 and 2 % or .0015% of total deaths.  The other 97% of livestock mortality is due to natural causes such as disease, birthing complications, weather, etc.  Additionally, there are funds set up to repay ranchers for any proven wolf kills.Grazing their livestock on our public lands costs the taxpayers $350 million per year just to manage it.  In return the BLM receives $1.35 per cow and calf pair (per month) for that pair to graze on YOUR land.  You can't feed a house cat for that.  Cattle grazed on our public lands produce 3% of the total national beef production each year.  In the process they are turning our public lands into deserts.Last year Defenders of Wildlife brought suit in District Court to stop the massacre of wolves after the delisting by the former Bush Administration.  Now, Defenders of Wildlife and the Humane Society of the United States are again trying to save these wolves, but the prognosis doesn't look good.  If we can't stop this in the court, LETS STOP IT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.This is where you can make your voice heard and be counted.  Just call toll-free 1-800-344-9453.  After the automated greeting dial 3 (for endangered species) then immediately dial 0 (zero) for the operator.  This will put you in touch with a live person that you can voice your concerns to.  PLEASE BE POLITE but firm.  Give them your name and the state you are calling from.  Let them know that you want all the wolves to stay under Endangered Species protection.  Some suggestions for talking points are as follows:1. This decision is based on flawed, biased science.2. Wildlife biologists do not agree with the delisting.3. This sets a very poor precedent for this new administration and will alienate the majority of Americans.4. You can't save the environment and ignore the wildlife as one cannot exist without the other.  If Mr. Salazar and Pres. Obama are serious about climate change and the environment this shows a lack of understanding on their parts. 5.

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: Some of this is so sad! That's our world :( people should realize how much value there is in keeping these areas diverse. "},{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Video description: Top 3 Most Memorable Wild Animal Experiences Spawned from a viewer comment, I discuss 2 (actually 3) of my most memorable animal experiences while in the backcountry. And they were all caught on video.\nTranscript: Let's talk about some fun animal experiences that I have, at least the two that stand out most of all my time in the backcountry, and I happen to get them on video. Let's take a look at them next. This is coming from actually a viewer comment. That is EQ3282 is his YouTube name, her YouTube name, one or the other. Let's see. Have you ever encountered a bear during a hike slash backpacking trip? And to further that question, ever encounter an aggressive bear or other dangerous animal during an excursion? How would you handle either situation? Well, I've come across bear scat and I've come across bear tracks, but I've never actually ran into a black bear out in the forest. That's the only kind of bears where I live are black bears. But I wanted to talk about two other instances and how I handle them. First, we'll start off with the porcupine. Those of you who have been around long enough and enjoy watching the backpacking videos in full are already aware of this. But I was out in an area called the High Uintas and I was doing some filming. I was on a solo backpacking trip. I turned around and thought, oh, there's something. I didn't know what it was. As it got closer, of course, it was a porcupine. But I thought if I go down this direction, I'm going to get a good angle on them and get some really good video footage of them. Well, as it happens, we kind of met down there, but then he turned and started walking straight towards me. And he kept coming. He kept coming and he kept coming. And I kept filming the whole time. What eventually happened, and I remember thinking about this, I'm like, how close is he going to get? This is really interesting. He came all the way up, took his paw, and actually put it on my foot. That's just awesome. So part of how you handle those types of situations is one, knowing the animals around you and what you should and should not do. Now, porcupines are not aggressive animals. They don't have good eyesight. So I don't know. Maybe he thought I was a tree. I have no idea. But I wasn't too concerned about the porcupine. Again, that comes from that knowledge base of understanding the animals in your area. Now, the second one, and this one had me pretty scared. It's coming down a trail, and I kind of, Now, as bull moose go, it wasn't a huge one. But nevertheless, it's a big moose. All right. I don't care if it's a small bull moose or a big one. The thing's still big. But come around and he looks at me. I look at him. I'm a little too close in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his, in his zone. And what he does is he squares up with me. Well, take a look. Go on now. Go on now.    Although I do have some good footage of you. I think we're just kind of right in his way. There he goes. He's all right. So you saw the video, what he does. He kind of squares up with me. He lowers his head and his ears lay back on his head. That is a sign of aggression with moose. So in this situation, what I did, this is one reason why I like to carry a gun with me. It was interesting because I was trying to film and get the gun out at the same time because I'm always, because I really want to get stuff on film. Um, now had he been running, had he charged me, uh, the filming of it, that's a whole different story. I would have dropped that camera in a heartbeat, but I, I did open my ribs pack. I did get my gun out and that's actually where all the shaky footage is going on. And then you heard me talk to him. And if my memory serves correct, I kind of went into this weird, nervous accent. I don't know why, but, um, and just to kind of let him know, Hey, look, I'm not here to hurt you, buddy. It's okay. And then he decided, ah, whatever, you're not worth it. And he turned and went on his way. So how would I handle those situations? At least with an animal, it can cause some serious, serious damage. Yes, a porcupine is going to make it for a very unpleasant experience. If it were to take its quills and stick you, uh, the moose, it could get a lot worse. Um, that's how I handled the situation. Had he come at me? Yes, I would have opened fire. Actually, some of the things I was thinking is, is, is there a tree nearby that I could run behind and use that to create some space between us? And that's interesting when you're in those situations, man, just all this stuff goes through your head. But, um, yeah, those are, those are the two most memorable experiences I've had with animals. You know, aside from the really closeups I've had with deer, um, oh, actually twin moose. I'll just roll in very quick footage on this one. I just remembered I got real up close and personal with twin moose. Now, again, understanding the animals, I was very observant for a long time before they approached me and knew likely that mom was not around. And I was continually scanning the area to make sure that she wasn't around. And it's not uncommon for moose at a certain age for the, the cow to actually leave the calves alone for the day and then come back. Not uncommon. Um, that one just kind of happened. I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. And for whatever reason, they weren't too worried about me, the two twins. But, uh, that was a very memorable book, memorable experience too. So I guess that's a total of three. Anyway, I thought I'd make a quick video about it. See ya.\nComment: Not as cool as yours but I had a bizarre experience once with a hummingbird\nI was probably, 13 or so and lived by Shawnigan lake on southern Vancouver Isalnd which is rural. Anyways, it was spring or early summer and I was burning some trash in a barrel in the yard wearing my bright red baseball jacket. This jacket had stainless steel buttons. So,I am burning the garbage when I see this hummingbird fly maybe 5 feet away and about 2 feet above my head.making its distinctive hum, its just staring at me as its sitting there(flying). Well, I guess it though I was some motherload feeder,lol, because it came right up and stuck its beak into one of the steel buttons(the female one had a small hole straight through), realizing there was zip in that one it reversed to find the other button below and tried again but still no sweet syrope to be had then it did a final back away, stop, stare and buzzed away."},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Finally breaking the camera out again and decided to walk some land in search of sheds, enjoy!\nTranscript: Hey guys, what's up? It's Champlea7. I know I haven't made a video in a super long time, but my camera is actually out of commission right now. I left it at my buddy's house and I haven't seen him for about two months. I went on a hog hunt with him, so I'm using my buddy, the Texas Bone Hunters video camera. And I'm back here on a wildlife management area today near my house in Dallas, Texas. It's about 15 minutes from my house and there's got to be a couple thousand acres back here I'm thinking. I mean, there is just a ton of land to come in here and I mean, I'm kind of just trail hopping right now. I'm doing a shed hunting video today. It's January the 27th or the 28th, one of the two days, Saturday, but I'm back here ready to find some sheds, hopefully bring you guys a quality video, so stay tuned. Well, guys, I know you're probably watching this video to get a couple of shed hunting information from me, so I'm going to share some with you right now, guys. First thing, this is a really new area to me. I really haven't come back here a lot. I've come back here to do a little bit of bow fishing. You might have seen some of my bow fishing videos, but I noticed a lot of the land that was back from where I bow fish is a wildlife management area, so that's why I'm in here today. This is really my first time in here and what you want to do, you really want to pick apart your cover whenever you're shed hunting. Look for any sort of geographic region that might hold deer more, like openings within some really heavily wooded forests. Look for a sign. Keep away from those areas that are devoid of signs. Try not to trail hop. I'm really guilty of doing that a lot. I do get lucky sometimes trail hopping, but you could probably find a lot more if you look for a sign. I've got a rub right here in front of me. These deer in Texas actually rut around late December into January, so I know that this is probably kind of fresh and there's some deer hanging around here, but I know a lot of bucks still haven't shed right now, especially here in the Lone Star State because we're so far south. It's really not a hard winter on these deer, so I'm really looking for older sheds maybe. Just anything that might be in here. There's a ton of woods. There's no way someone's covered at all, so I'm going to try to get a couple finds. So stick around. Hey guys, the Texas bone hunter is over here. He's found some bone. Let's see what he's got. He's probably already picked it up here. Man, this is some thick stuff. I can't believe deer are walking through here. Yeah, I know. That is a very nice shed. Was it laying right there? Well, yeah. I mean, it's not even chewed up or anything, dude. Yeah. That's an awesome shed. It's all... Yeah, it's in very good condition. Very good condition. I don't know how long I've been wanting to find a shed for myself, dude, now. Yeah? I'm so pumped. So it was right here, huh? Yeah. Wow. Very nice. Well guys, just found this bad boy right here. Little boar, it looks like. Pretty good cutters on him, actually. This spot of the woods back here is definitely dominated by pigs. You can just tell it's all tore up in here and pigs everywhere. But I found the bottom skull and then found the top skull not even 5 or 10 yards away from it. Pretty easy find and a pretty cool thing to add to my collection. So we're starting to hit some bone here now, whether it be skull or actual sheds. We'll keep in tune, guys, so stay with us. Hey guys, just found my first antler here. I haven't even gone to pick it up yet. I'm going to do an ATL picture of it with my phone and on the camera. But I am excited. It looks really good. I'm about 15 yards away from it right now. So let's go see it. Oh man. Wow, that's a good shed. Ha. Guys, we're on some wildlife management area land here. In Texas. And by God, he's got a split brow. It's pretty nice. A G2 and G3 and he's pretty chunky for being back here. Man. Well, that's awesome. I'm glad we got one, guys. I'm ready to go find some more. Oh my God. Wow. Alright. I ain't kidding you guys right now. I just want to do a walking away shot with this shed. And there's another shed not even laying 10 yards away. Right on the same trail. Looks to be pretty old. So there's some more. Shed's obviously to be found. Keep watching, guys. Wow. Alright, guys. What I'm doing now is what's called gridding. After finding those two antlers, there's a pretty good chance that the other one's going to be pretty close by. So what you want to do is wherever you found that antler, just kind of go back and forth. Help you use landmarks. And trying to find the other side. Basically making a big sweep where you can't miss it. You're not trail hopping. You're doing more of a systematic search. So stay with me. And I'll check in if I get anything. Thanks for watching!\nComment: Nothing like that first shed of the year!   Go shed hunters!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"0"}]}

Listen as the guide describes their behavior.  The laughing starts at 30 seconds\nTranscript: We're having a super good time. They actually usually laugh when the meat comes out. It's aggression, possession, they're not super happy. I told you, now here comes our princess. Chip off. So, at this point, I kind of created an invisible barrier, basically. I've given it to them, and if I act like I'm going to take it back, that's when they're going to get really mad at me. And I just think, Lord, I've got offense here. So, are you guys going to share? Oh, yeah? Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Oh, come here. Are you taking a video? Well, I'm going to get my mail first. Alright, what? Gone. They don't have to necessarily chew. They have a digestive tract to suit their jaw power. 2,000 pounds of pressure per square inch these guys have, and their jaw power is the strongest of all mammals. Come here. Here you go. You think she even tasted hers? No, I doubt it. Now, these guys are apex predators. They're in Africa up there with the lions. Apex predator means you have no natural enemies. But these guys naturally hate lions, and lions naturally hate them. They have to share territory, and they share the food that's on that territory. So it's a kind of battle between them, and they will kill each other given the opportunity. They don't eat each other. They normally leave the body in the path for everybody else to see. That's what's happening to you if you come treading our way. How many of those can take down a lion? Two or three? Usually about four. Four. So these guys are actually so intelligent. Yeah, yeah. What these guys is, you have a couple of these together. We have a clan. You get a clan of hyenas. And we have ourselves a mini clan. They can get up to even, say, 35 or so in a clan. And that's definitely a force to be reckoned with. They are amazing hunters, and they can run at right about 30 miles an hour, 28 to 30 miles an hour, which might not seem like it's super, super fast. But these guys have what the cats don't have, which is stamina. They have a huge heart. It's actually bigger than a lion's heart. So they can keep their pace up and keep it up and keep it up. You can run the biggest guy into the dirt doing that. But when it comes to strategies, these guys have some of the best. And they can come up with them at the spur of the moment, depending on the situation, too, because they're up there with primate intelligence. They are so incredibly smart. So there's our grizzly bear, hyenas, primates. They're all up there with the most intelligence of all mammals. You guys want one more treat? Oh, they're like, no! No, it's a pretty rough life. It's so hot. Ooh! So they go to the mooing, and that's the moo. That's the good noise I wanted you to hear. Ooh! That's the good noise. It's like them saying hi. It's almost, in a way, like a perfect cat. But these guys are not cats at all. They're not dogs. They're actually more closely related to a mongoose than anything else. It's kind of cool. So they are such a unique animal. We're always learning something new about a hyena. Socially, they're very unique. Physically, they're very unique. Both a male and a female carry the same male membrane. That's how females give birth. It's an external process. It's horrific. I wouldn't wish it on my husband. I mean, yeah. It's pretty bad. So a lot of the times, because of that, first couple cubs you have don't make it. Couple litters, I mean. The first couple cubs usually have about two to three per litter. First couple times you have one, though, they don't make it because of the external birthing process. They suffocate in the canal. About the third time around, you should be able to have a live birth. And if you are finally born as a live hyena, you're the only mammal born with open ears, open eyes, and a full set of teeth to eat meat the day you're born. Oh. Yeah. And it's so ingrained in them, to kill anything that might ever take food out of their own mouth, that actually even goes for your own siblings. So if you're the first one born, you're probably the strongest. You'll probably end up killing your fellow siblings. Come on. Okay, go ahead. She's the princess. She's like, I just put it right here, honey. They're amazing swimmers, believe it or not.

This could make him the world's oldest living tiger! He came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002 and his wonderful \"purrsonality\" as made him a favorite among our volunteers :)Subscribe to our Website:  Big Cat Rescue on Twitter  Big Cat Rescue on Facebook  Big Cat Rescue on Google+  for cat themed items  YOU!\nTranscript: Say hello to Flavio. Flavio's a retired circus tiger and he came to live at Big Cat Rescue in 2002. This handsome boy is surely a favorite for many of the volunteers who have the pleasure of caring for him. As you can hear, he's definitely one of the most talkative cats at the sanctuary, always having the time to walk over and chuff hello. Flavio holds a unique distinction. As to the best of our knowledge, he was born in 1989, which would make him 23 years old. This would be the equivalent of 109 human years, possibly making him the world's oldest living tiger. And I think everyone would agree, he is still looking good. Flavio was also considered one of the smartest circus tigers ever known. For years, he performed flawlessly as part of a light and music number, while owned by renowned circus animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Gunther's last show was in 1990. Following his retirement, Gunther's son and other trainers attempted to work with the cats, but these magnificent creatures had other ideas. Bengali, Sarmati, and Reno all stopped performing and got a one-way ticket to retire at Big Cat Rescue. Bengali and Sarmati are brothers, and arrived at the sanctuary two years prior to Flavio. They were five years old at the time, but had not performed for approximately two years. Flavio performed for 13 years, but eventually the circus stopped using him in their traveling show. So after spending over a decade in the entertainment industry, Flavio earned a one-way ticket to Big Cat Rescue, where instead of performing, he could work on his tan and check out the lakefront view. We recently celebrated Flavio's 23rd birthday by making him a tiger-worthy 23-pound meat cake. Flavio's birthday cake was made up of layers of beef, turkey, and our balanced carnivore diet. We transferred Flavio's cake onto a tiger sized cardboard plate, and then gathered round to watch the birthday boy devour his tasty treat. Another one of Flavio's favorite enrichment items is Christmas trees. We treat all of the cats to their holiday enrichment each year, and Flavio simply loves the smell of pine trees. Chewing on the branches, using them to scratch his back, and just falling asleep in a pine-scented heaven. Flavio also enjoys playing with his tiger-sized boomer ball and the occasional fruit snack. We utilize mirrors as part of the sanctuary's enrichment program, and when Flavio saw himself for the first time in 23 years, all he wanted to do was make friends with the very handsome tiger, staring right back at him. While he's not as active as some of the other cats that call Big Cat Rescue home, Flavio can now choose to do as much or as little as he desires. We ensure that Flavio is perfectly comfortable, and we give him daily meds to help soothe his stiff joints. Just like you and I, sometimes Flavio decides that he just doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So our animal caregivers, like Marie, simply use a longer stick to feed him his meds. Well, that was Big Cat Rescue room service early morning for Flavio. We're all very grateful that Flavio retired to Florida, no longer a part of the entertainment industry. While Flavio will unfortunately never experience the wild, we provide him with the next best thing, and truly enjoy every moment shared with this special boy.\nComment: 2:18.. How Funny.

Today Simon, the Founder of Wildlife Aid Foundation, was called out to rescue an adult Fox that was tangled up in a shed somewhere in Epsom.To his amazement, the lady opened the door to a very embarrassed looking fox who had come a cropper on a lawn mower's power cable!Simon struggled to understand just how the poor Fox could get so entangled in such a small piece of exposed cable. He did his best to restore the Fox's dignity and freedom, however the constriction on his leg was too bad and required treatment back at the wildlife hospital.As it's St George's Day we have decided to called the Fox St George (only for online referencing), however we can't see him slaying any Dragon's anytime soon!You can follow St George's progress on our Facebook page: www.facebook.com/wildlifeaidAbout TheWildlifeAidTVEver wanted to see the goings on behind the scenes at a Wildlife Rescue Centre? Well now you can! We have super cute hedgehogs eating their dinner, dramatic rescues of wild deer and everything in between.\nTranscript: Well, we've got a fox trapped in a shed and apparently he's trapped in some wire in the shed, so I'm not quite sure what kit we're going to need. Hello, do you have a fox trapped in a shed? Yes, it's a one hind leg, very tight. Is it? Yeah, he got so frightened up there. Well, I can see the injuries. He looks very tightly constricted by one of his legs. It looks incredibly tight. I don't really, he's mangy as well, which is a slight worry. What I want to try and do is grasp him so when I finish he can't leg it at great speed. All right, foxy dogs. How he's got stuck around that is absurd. I'm trying to get the fox out without damaging the lady's lawnmower, which is going to be quite interesting. I'm afraid he's already bitten through the mains cable by himself. There's nothing I can do about that. That was not me, I'm innocent. If I can get this handle off the lawnmower, that might give me a bit of slack to play with. Okay, now, I'm getting somewhere. That's it, now the pressure's off. All right, fella. You could have done this if you tried. Okay, he doesn't know it yet, but he's out. So before he knows he's out, I just need to get him grasped so he can't escape, which I've now done. Now I can move that out of the way. I can put the lady's lawnmower back together in a minute, but it has made the leg swollen, and because he's got mange anyway, he'll have to come back into the centre, and we'll see how much damage it's done to the leg. If it's been shut for too long, then obviously there's going to be a constriction problem. You tell them what one pot's contained without me being bitten. That's a bonus. Do they know how long he was stuck? Probably not more than overnight. I'm hoping there's not going to be a serious constriction. Toes are nice and warm. Yeah. Still very swollen. So what I'm probably going to do is shave that bit, so that we can really keep an eye on it. I'm not going to clip it right to the skin, just so that we can see what we're looking at, because sometimes these injuries take a few days to really show themselves. Having clipped it, you can really see how red it is. If this tissue dies here, then there's nothing you can do to stop it. So what we don't want to see is that going sort of black and hard tomorrow. I'm just going to put some of this lovely gel on it today. Just to keep it moist while the skin is hopefully healing. You can see the mange all around this area. It's really common to see it on the rumps of foxes. They quite often get sore patches over the bony hips as well. His heart's really slow. Wheezy as well. Well, he's having antibiotics anyway, for any secondary skin infections that they have from the mange, which is also going to help with his chesty breathing there. And then this is the treatment for the mange. They have to have this every week for three weeks. And then the final treatment will be a spot-on treatment before he goes free. Hopefully, if that leg's OK, we might only have to keep him a couple of weeks. Well, we've done all we can for now. He'll be with us two weeks. He'll be very lucky, probably three weeks, but he should go out in a lot better state than he is now. It's just a matter for the next 72 hours of keeping an eye on that wound, because that is absolutely critical. It's a tinny little house. How do you like it? The one in the corner's just non-stop stuffed his face since he got here. Like, oh, yeah, Liz's face is wicked. Ow! Ow!\nComment: Can you start sharing if these animals actually recover and are able to go free again? Or if they have to stay in care or unfortunately don't make it. I'm left wondering what has happened to this little guy. Thank you for showing the vets work as well.  You are such an amazing man to take care and save these animals from such scarry situations.

This is a leopard subspecies that lives in eastern Russia, and a 2007 study counted only about 30 individuals in total. The footage comes to us from a camera trap, which is a camera that's triggered by heat and motion and which can be left in the wilderness for weeks at a time. Using thousands of photos from cameras like these, scientists recently found that the Amer leopards have actually doubled in number in less than a decade. Camera traps are especially useful for monitoring rare and elusive animals whose habitat is difficult to survey, such as the snow leopard, which lives at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, or the rare Andean mountain cat, which lives at an even higher elevation in the Andes in South America. The endangered bay cat had never been filmed before 2009. That's when a camera trap caught this short clip. Scientists know next to nothing about the biology of this animal, which lives only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. And in 2011, a camera trap captured the first known video footage of the African golden cat. This is a species that few researchers have ever seen in person. And then earlier this year, a camera trap caught this incredible clip of a golden cat in action. The idea of photographing animals remotely has been around for a while. The first camera traps used tripwire and loud powder flash guns, which must have terrified the animals, but the images were captivating. When National Geographic published these images in 1906, they were the first wildlife photos ever to appear in the magazine. But it just wasn't practical for widespread use until the technology caught up. It was actually demand from hunters that really spurred the commercial market and with the switch from film to digital, the number of scientific studies using camera traps has increased year after year. Most camera traps today have what's called a passive infrared sensor, which detects sudden changes in temperature when an animal walks into the frame. For nighttime, they're equipped with either a regular flash or an infrared flash, which provides less clarity, but it won't startle the animals. Camera traps really showed their scientific value starting in the 1990s, when scientists studying Bengal tigers in India began combining camera trap images with statistical software, and this let them produce measurements of things like tiger abundance and tiger density, which are necessary for any conservation plan. Tigers and many other cat species essentially wear their fingerprints on the side of their bodies with these unique markings. So if you want to estimate the total population in an area, you set cameras out and get a sample of cats that you can identify. And then you do it again, and the number of cats photographed twice gives you enough information to approximate what the total population is. This is an adaptation of an older method that involved actually capturing and tagging animals. But instead of tagging them, you just photograph them. It's a method used in a recent study of Saharan cheetahs in Algeria, which found that this critically endangered subspecies is living at extremely low densities. The camera traps also have some law enforcement applications. Some groups are starting to use them to catch poachers, and they can send the images instantly over cell phone networks. Right now, about 80% of wild cat species are believed to be declining, and several are critically endangered, like the tiger. Just a century ago, there were 100,000 tigers in the world, and now there are around 3,200. The population of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia is down to 450. And this video from a camera trap in what was supposed to be a protected area shows part of the reason why.\nComment: This was stunning.. Damn, 7days and their habitat is gone. That's insane.

It was a delight to be driving and seeing the wildlife right off to the side of the road. When we came upon the Buffalo crossing the road right in front of us it was amazing. I just had my hand out the window and kept filming them as we passed.I wanted to not have any background music on this video so you could hear the real sounds of the Buffalo but when we came upon them there was a Harley Davidson motorcycle stopped and they were afraid to drive through the heard since they are quite loud. They asked if we could drive and have them on one side of the vehicle to sort of shield them. When I got home and listened to the video I was disappointed to hear the motorcycle through almost the whole video. So I had to use the background music sadly..Yes, that is me standing next to the painted Buffalo also. When you drive through the town of Custer they have these painted Buffalo on every street corner. None of them are painted the same either and they are quite unique to see. I would of loved to taken a photo of each one but there are so many of them it would of taken a couple hours I'm sure to get to each one of them.A little more info on Custer State Park:Custer State Park is a state park and wildlife reserve in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, USA. The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional 22,900 acres (93 km2) were added to the park. The park covers an area of over 71,000 acres (287 km2) of hilly terrain and is home to many wild animals.The park is home to a famous herd of 1500 free roaming bison. Elk, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is famous for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park.Background music from Kevin MacLeod called Deliberate Thought\nTranscript: You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\nComment: Thanks Chris , You have to wonder what those Bison are thinking Like what are these strange box's walking through our place Well they can just wait till Im across the road lol I bet it would be hard to train those donkeys to ride and those deer sheding there winter coats I was born 250 years to late to see this country the way I would have liked to , Was that you leaning on that Buffalo at the end ?

Www.facebook.com/wedoitoutdoors\nTranscript: Everybody, it's January 12th, we're in Ohio, I got the 22 single shot out, and I'm going to do a little bit of squirrel hunting today. Really really warm, sun's trying to come out right now, it's a little bit overcast, but probably mid-60s. Good day to get out in the woods, go for a little walk, got to pull a stand here later from both seasons, so might as well take the 22 and see if we can't get some squirrels. But I'm by myself, so we'll see how this filming goes with squirrel hunting. Hopefully I can have a little bit of action for you guys, so stay tuned. I'm definitely in the middle of squirrels, we've got one, two, three, four, we got five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60. Well I've got two squirrels down, and like three or four more above me, my gun jams, and nothing with me to get the shell out, so I guess we're going to gather my two squirrels and head back to the house, get the gun unjammed, come back out, try round two. Well, got my gun unjammed, not sure what happened, looked like the side of the shell kind of split open or something, fingers wouldn't grab a hold of it to eject it out, but got me a little knife and popped it right out, shot a couple more times, and seems to be okay now. So, got these two squirrels here recovered, one fell down the bush here, took me a couple minutes to find it, he crawled up underneath, but I got both of those, so I think we're going to walk up on the hill here, see if we can't get a couple more, and we'll call it a day. So far, seems like a good day to be out squirrel hunting, so stick with us here and we'll see if we can't get a couple more out here. Well, I just made it up here to the top of the hill, seen one small gray squirrel there way in the back, but I'm going to keep on moving slow, pretty big hill I just climbed, it's crazy, January 12th, I'm in a hoodie and a t-shirt, and I'm sweating like crazy squirrel hunting. Just a couple weeks ago there, we got a big snowstorm, temperature's down in the teens, everything froze up, this week it's 60 degrees, so, gotta love Ohio, next week it'll be snowing again, so, can't complain, don't like the weather, wait a couple days, but stay with us, we're going after some more squirrels.
